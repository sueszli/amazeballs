# Exercise 2 - Group 02 | An Inspection of Amazon Reviews

### Files in this repository

- The final [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb)
- The [presentation.pdf](./presentation.pdf)
- The executive 2 page [report.pdf](./report.pdf)

Additionally we have included the [Initial Approach & Workplan](./Initial%20Approach%20&%20Workplan/) for better context of the final notebook. **Nothing** inside this folder is required to run the final hand in.

### Additional Notes

If you desire to reproduce the results we suggest running the notebook on a T4 Google Colab instance due to the computational complexity of the used BERT-based models.
