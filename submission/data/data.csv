4.0,"TRY THIS! test on FACE for match not hands, evens out skin tone, not for dry skin","I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn't look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).Overall, it isn't for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

4.0,"Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Creamy,  requires very little to use. No actual change to wrinkles.","I'm not a big believer in all the hocus pocus claims made by every single women's skin care product on the market. They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage. This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines.

5.0,These bandages have many uses; sticks to itself and not to skin or fur; not only tattoo grip tape,"These bandages have many uses. There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced.

There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products, and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications?

It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.

5.0,"Softest hands ever, lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil, lemon oil, orange oil, rosemary","I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down.

4.0,What a “Cheeky” Product! 🍑,"I can honestly say that this was the first time I’ve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I’m always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they’d be super easy to “seat” properly if you had an extra hand.I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you’re standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn’t experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I’m not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.I’m sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it’s hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time.

5.0,"Excellent, party on brothers and sisters.","[[VIDEOID:7cfc995b010d23bc7176b91f843fecfa]] Hotep and party on brothers and sisters and thank you for looking at my review of the HMPRT 80s 90s Costume, A Black Mullet Rocker Wig and Wig Cap, Black T-Shirt, Wayne’s World Baseball Cap, and Inflatable Guitar. What I like about this set it's a spoof of Wayne's World and it comes with a Wayne's World cap, a wig, T shirt and an inflatable guitar. The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.“Wayne's World"" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled ""Wayne's Power Minute"" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from ""Wayne's Power Minute""), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show ""live"" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first ""Wayne's World"" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season. The only thing I didn't like about the Cap is that it clearly looks like a woven Cap on the ad, but the Cap that I was sent is definitely a screen print which I guess is, OK?  ” NOT”.

4.0,Perfect for skin + hair on newborns- great ethnic option!!,"This was a great product made to be helpful For moisturizing but, also being sensitive enough for use on a newborns skin. The baby i had ordered this for, has a unique combo- half Icelandic and half African… Creating skin mixture that needs very delicate and natural products that still can provide plenty of moisture. This product delivered!!After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia’s baby bath oil on the scalp. Not only was it very sensitive and user-friendly, it took care of the issue within a few days.. The other concern was the possibility of getting product in babies eyes, if added to the overall bathwater.. of course, I used my best efforts to keep this from happening- but, I found dipping washcloth into the water and wiping off face… Absolutely caused zero problems- I was totally surprised and impressed!!Knowing the African culture needs a bit of moisturizer in skin care as well as hair care… This has covered both needs in just this one product. I’m certain as this newborn grows we may need to adjust course and add more specific hair care regiment. As for now, this is doing just fine- and best of all leaves baby smelling amazing!!So, if looking for a product that is gentle enough to use on a newborn… That has taken the precautions to keep their skin safe… Using only natural products- and has the ability to moisturize and even clear up cradle cap.. just a few drops of this to the bathwater- can handle the trouble spots no problem.. loving it!!",2020-10-02 03:40:02.355,0.0,False,All_Beauty,en,positive,0.8594908118247986,0.9851159453392029,[],5.0
3.0,"Calling this ""Virtually indestructible"" should be a crime.","I've had this model trimmer for about 2 years now.  At first, it was pretty good value for light trimming.  But the trimmer guard is a flimsy plastic piece that easily breaks and it's difficult to find a replacement trimmer guard (no results from the Remington website) for this model.  As well, the NiMH battery is pretty pathetic, not only short lasting when it is brand new and fully-charged, but NiMH battery tech has a terrible lifespan.  Why any manufacturer would use it in this day and age baffles me. Unless it was about planned obsolescence all along. Overall, this is an attractive product for light trimming and delivers somewhat, for awhile, until one of the cheap components fails and you have to buy another because the battery is not replaceable nor is the guard made to last.",2023-02-13 18:04:12.919,0.0,False,All_Beauty,en,negative,0.5446611046791077,0.9287992119789124,['good'],1.0

5.0,"excellent at evening out rosy skin, great smelling tinted mineral sunscreen, great as primer","Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin.

5.0,Never Knew My Feet Could Be So Soft!,"My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.Here's what happened:Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothingDay 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skinDay 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feetDay 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toesDay 6-Next to no peelingDay 7 & 8-No peeling at allResults:The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked.

5.0,Deep Hydration,"There's a Chinese actress who attributes her perfect skin to twice-daily sheet masks. After using one per night for several months, I totally believe they work. This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also. The best part about this set is that you get so many masks. You can try using one nightly to see how it changes your skin. I highly recommend it.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

Oilier skin tends to age better. I have dry skin, but I have been moisturizing and protecting with SPF since my teens).MY skin: Mid 40s, very clear, very fair, minimal/no lines, supple, leans dry, has Rosacea (non-acne, just flushing and redness from visible veins). My skin loves hydration, oils, thicker heavier products.This product:--stay fresh, pump style tube container (think of a toothpaste container with a pump)-- thin, light, but rich lotion.--smooth, glides on--absorbs quickly, no lingering sheen or greasiness.--plays well with other products (ie; toners, serums, SPF, make up)--gentle, non irritating.--skin nourishing ingredients--no added fragrance; barely there naturally occurring scent.When I use it: daytime after serum (if I use one) but before SPF.Quite a range of experiences and preferences, but that make sense since we all have different skin and skin care needs. So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier. Maybe over time? I am thinking this might be good for dehydrated oily skin, or normal to lightly dry skin. I am just guessing.I would use it to hold in other hydrating products like a thin mask. Or MAYBE on days when I just want something on and I don't want to fuss.Unexpectedly great for hands. Immediate softness. The backs of my hands feel super wonderful after applying this. The pump container makes it easy to dole out on the go. Would be great for keeping in a purse.Since it is thin but rich as well as the ease of application makes it REALLY nice as a neck and chest cream. If this formula is supposed to increase skin oil over time, then having that added advantage applied to the neck (naturally not oil area) could be a game changer for those concerned with skin on the neck.I think it is lovely, overall. 4 stars",2020-10-03 17:08:06.228,1.0,False,All_Beauty,en,positive,0.881662905216217,0.9909141063690186,[],5.0

5.0,"Softens, Smooths and Soothes Skin","I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf.

It comes in a generous large pump dispenser bottle that is beautiful. The shampoo is just an average smelling product but again that is not what determines the rating of my review.Inside of the bottle is a shampoo that produces an average lather. I let it sit in my hair for a while whenever I use it to make sure the working ingredients can do their job. It rinses out quite easily so no issues there. I felt my hair just looked ok when I use it and haven’t noticed any effects in regards to their promises. There hasn’t been an increase of hair loss. There is maybe a little bit less hair loss when it comes to when I am in the shower I notice maybe a little bit less hair in the drain. Other than that I really don’t see that much effect when I use it. But it is not expensive and it is not a bad shampoo.

5.0,LOVE! super gentle manual exfoliation & chemical peeling product; deep cleans pores; brightens,"I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!Benefits, and a little more info:--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth. Softly cleanses skin, non irritating.--Skin soothing: TECA™ formula (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) delivers a soothing benefit to skin; helps create bright skin.

5.0,Very sturdy and worth it,"purchased for my grandsons to use when visiting..... it is large.... large enough for an an adult to get into.  The material is a cotton canvas... not terribly thick, but not too thin in my opinion.  It was relatively easy to put together... I like that this is a bottom floor attached.  It is quite popular to stay grandma's and camp out.... I added some &#34;nap pads&#34; which are perfect for the 5 and 2 year old.  I also added a stuffed bear and alligator and a camp lantern that is a lantern or a star map night light.  Honestly, I keep it up in the corner of my living room so it is ready for any visit. It does come with a handy bag that has a handle if you'd like to store it when not in use.  The poles are wood... a pine I believe... very sturdy.  I would recommend this teepee...  I always update if there are any issues that may be helpful.3/25/2016 UPDATE:  ...so I just finished deconstructing the teepee and felt an undate with tips might be helpful... first... you will never get the canvas teepee back into the canvas bag provided... it's like folding/rolling a really thick fitted sheet and trying to get into a tube sock.... BUT the wooden poles fit nicely into the canvas bag along with the plastic connector pieces... it would have been nice if the connectors gripped the poles better and stayed connected during the deconstruct phase... however... I just removed all the holed top pieces and then turned the teepee upside down and shook it sort of like a pillow case... the lower pieces eventually come out...  I just rolled the teepee up, put all the poles and connector pieces in the bag and set in a large drawer I have.  I would have lowered my rating one star for the deconstruct hassle, but honestly, my grandsons love it so much I just can't. The quality is such that this is going to last for many years if we take care of it.  It's just a matter of learning how to use it in an efficient manner.  Also... I have hard wood floors, so I went to a local carpet store and purchased some carpet padding.  I cut into a circle and place it under the teepee when I have it set up... I worry less about bonked heads that way - grandsons 5 years and 2 years.  Ok!

4.0,GREAT TOY IF YOUR CHILD IS YOUNG ENOUGH AND LIGHT ENOUGH,"My great-grandson liked this a lot and really enjoyed riding it.  He's not a large kid, but is one year older than the recommended ages for the toy.  He is within the weight limit, which I think is 50 pounds or under.  He can probably enjoy it for about a year, but he was almost too big for it now so you probably don't want to get this for a child who is approaching the upper age limit, which I think the box said was 5.  Also, if you have a big child close to the maximum age and maximum weight, they might not fit the toy.  At around a $200 price, I consider this to be a luxury toy and you might be able to find toys for a lot less that would be just as much fun for a kid.  I recommend getting it for kids at the lower end of the age range (2 or 3), so they can enjoy it for a few years before they outgrow it.  Of course you can always donate it when they do outgrow it.  Not much to assemble on it and the few parts that need to be put on are easy to install.  The only real downside to this toy is the initial charge time of 18 hours.  Kids are impatient (some adults are too) and if you present this to them and then they find out they can't use it until the next day, there could be some disappointment.  Of course that could be a way to teach patience too.  After the initial overnight charge, the battery seemed to last quite well, so they should be able to enjoy a driving session until they lose interest and a recharge is needed.  This is not huge, but it is a large item that you need a storage place for and a place to plug it in while it is charging.  As several reviewers have said, this works better on hard surfaces.  This doesn't move very fast, but fast enough for younger kids; older kids might find it too slow.  Obviously too, as a kid gets older they might not find a toy like this that &#34;cool&#34;.  Since this is a motorized riding toy, obviously you do need to supervise a kid while riding it, especially younger ones; don't buy it if you think you are going to turn your kid loose with it and not have to watch them.  You need adequate space in your house or a big driveway to use this, as you probably don't want the kids driving it in the street, unless you live in a very low traffic residential area and/or are right beside them when they are using it.  Probably best for use on sidewalks or a fenced yard if you are going to use it outside.  Keep in mind too that if you go any great distance away from your house and the charge runs out, you now have a 50 pound toy to somehow get home.  How noisy a toy is also can be a factor on whether you want to get it or not; this runs reasonably quiet, which is a plus.  A fun toy for the appropriately aged small child.",2016-09-05 14:46:49.000,0.0,False,Toys_and_Games,en,positive,0.539174497127533,0.5167301297187805,"['recommended ages', 'older', 'approaching']",4.0

5.0,Great quality Goban (Go board),"If you're looking for a wonderful thinking game, this is an excellent purchase to get started. It comes with a Go instruction booklet as well, which hits all the high points of gameplay without being too long or boring. If you read your way through the entire book (about 20 illustrated pages) you will be well on your way to understanding most aspects of the game.Several tips to note about this board:It has 9x9 grid on one side and 13x13 on the other, which makes it the perfect board for beginners or those learning Go. These smaller sizes are normally used by less experienced players to learn the basics of the game, without being overwhelmed by the length of a full 19x19 match. A 9x9 game, depending on how long the players take to think about their moves, will take about 10 to 20 minutes, and a 13x13 game takes about 20 to 40 minutes.The wood is spruce and is very good quality for a beginner's board. I have not used it for very long so I don't know how long it would take the lines on the board to wear off or show signs of use. However, it's still in pristine quality from when I bought it, and I've used it quite thoroughly. Any dust or dirt can be easily wiped off with a dry or slightly damp cloth (it comes with instructions on how to care for the board).Of primary consideration is the quality of the Go stones that come with this board. If you don't have any stones, this is also a great purchase because the stones are rust-proof and will never crack, break, or corrode. They are nice and big, so they are easy to hold and become used to playing Go with. Another plus is that it comes with enough stones for a 19x19 game, so if you later choose to purchase a full sized board, you'll have enough stones to play with.Overall, a great purchase if you want to jump into learning how to play Go.",2011-06-30 01:31:46.000,3.0,True,Toys_and_Games,en,positive,0.8032124638557434,0.8432121276855469,[],5.0

5.0,Great Option..,"Used for one week daily before reviewing. It's a good case, not great but good. The phone case itself holds the phone securely and even has a lip for more protection.  It comes with a screen protector as well so the value is there. The wallet portion is just OK. I've had wallet cases that have more card slots while still being compact. I will have to take an additional wallet with me to hold all my cards. Three slots are not enough. The magnetic side is also not strong enough. Again, I've had other wallets that grip the phone when reconnected. This one feels not as strong. However, the snap closure prevents the phone from detaching in a fall which helps. So, I try not walk around  too much with it open. The case itself is thin enough to allow QI charging on the pad and in my vehicle. I can drop it in to the slot and it fits allows for fast charging. Finally, the case feels like leather. I know that it's not but it's not plastic-y.If it had enough slots to replace a normal wallet it would be perfect, but I will still give it 5 stars.",2021-07-05 20:30:59.377,0.0,True,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,en,positive,0.4440671503543854,0.9832575917243958,"['slots', 'lip', 'compact', 'screen', 'card']",3.0

5.0,Very Cute!,"This phone case is so cute! First of all, it looks better in person. I ordered the wine colored one with a simple embossed flourish on the cover for my teenage daughter. There is a flexible plastic/rubber case that fits directly on your phone. Then that case has magnets in it that keep it attached to the faux leather folder/wristlet. There is a magnetic clasp that keeps the folder closed. There are 2 card slots as well as a pocket to slide bills into. That's plenty of room for a teen. You wouldn't want to put much more in there due to thickness. The whole thing would not stay closed as well.  The magnets on the back of the separate phone case are pretty strong. She was able to stick her phone on the refrigerator and it did not slip or fall. There are not a lot of reasons that you would want to put your phone there, but if you do, then know that it's strong enough to hold it there. This wallet style phone case is perfect for my daughter to use. She doesn't usually carry a purse with her, but she always takes her phone with her. Now she can store her student ID and a little bit of cash with her easily. The case does not interfere with charging or headphone ports.*I received this case for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My daughter loves using this to go to the movies or places with her friends. She can slip her debit card or cash in the back and she's good to go. She does not like the wallet style phone cases, so this is a good alternative. There is a piece underneath the straps that can be removed. It's a little difficult to put back in place, but not impossible. The bands stretch so they can accommodate slight thickness such as keys. The Under Armour logo is pretty discreet.

5.0,Far More Versatile Than Standard Foldable Utility Shopping Cart,"This AMAZONBASICS FOLDING SHOPPING CART (Converts into Dolly, 40 inch Handle Height, Black) is so versatile!  It’s much better than a regular foldable shopping cart (e.g., [[ASIN:B00SK9P454 Whitmore utility shopping cart]] because it already has a bag (easily removeable) to contain your groceries, and it converts into a dolly.For many purposes, it’s better than my excellent [[ASIN:B001601WFU Safeco furniture-mover dolly]] (should be about $50, watch out for added shipping costs), because it’s upright (easier to maneuver than a wheeled platform dolly).  It’s also sturdier than my [[ASIN:B086D5JXQF Collapsible Luggage Cart]], which is very compact, but has a tiny cargo platform.The shopping cart/dolly is reasonably priced (about $58 on Amazon).  The maximum weight load is 110 lbs., which is as much as I can wrestle onto a dolly anyway.  The tall, broad bag opens out to hold at least two big grocery bags’ worth of groceries.  A big flap covers them up in bad weather.The cart easily folds flat for storage or for transport in the trunk of an auto.  Assembly is simple, and requires no tools.

5.0,"Amazing Suction, Excellent at Everything Except Thick Carpet Cleaning","I had never before heard of ProTeam and was very interested in trying out this vacuum cleaner, even though it is a unit more suited for business use. Right now we have a pair of Oreck vacuums, one being an upright and one being a canister vacuum. In most cases, this ProTeam vacuum outperforms them both. There are, however, some situations where it is not well-suited for home use.First off, this is my first backpack vacuum and I was not sure what to expect. My concern was that it would get heavy quickly and would add strain; this has been proven to not be the case with this unit. Being just under 12 pounds it is actually not too bad for extended use. That said, it cannot be worn comfortably slung over a single shoulder for more than a few minutes as it does get heavy when worn that way.The unit is easy to assemble without instructions but the instructions are clear and concise. I do recommend reading over the documentation that comes in the box, regardless.This vacuum has better suction than any other unit I have ever used. On bare skin is actually can be a little painful and leaves a mark. In spite of the power, this is actually a relatively quiet vacuum cleaner, making considerably less noise than most uprights and somewhat less than canister units I have used.My house has proven to be an excellent proving ground for this unit. We have a little hardwood flooring, linoleum, medium-pile cut carpet, ceiling fans, a light fixture we cannot easily reach, heavy Venetian blinds and several chairs the cats have adopted as their own. With the unit assembled and the proper attachments I set out to clean the house (my wife was actually pretty happy with this adventure).I started with the carpet in the living room and this proved to be the one area where the unit was not up to task. Most businesses do not go with cut pile carpet, favoring a Berber or tight weave, and for this kind of carpet this unit would excel. It did a fair job with the carpet, but I get better results with the upright. It rocked the wood floor though with the wide brush head and did far better than any broom. I took the duster attachment and went after the blinds and the vacuum's suction is so strong it started to pull the strings on the blinds - from the middle, even when the blinds were all the way down. And the blinds look brand new. The main event was a cushioned chair where the cats tend to sleep. With the upholstery attachment in place, this vacuum cleaned off the cat hair very thoroughly, such that you can't tell the cats favor that chair.The metal two-piece wand gives a good reach that I cannot get with the canister vacuum, and I was able for the first time to reach a specific light fixture in the house. The 50' cord also means not having to unplug the whole works, move to a new outlet and plug in again. Accessibility is very good with this unit.Now, in spite of the good things I encountered with this unit, there are a couple of things on which I think there could be some improvement. The 50' cord is just that - a long cord that does not have a coiling mount and cannot be retracted into the unit like some others do. There's no place to wrap it up or anything and that lends itself to kinking. The only other real complaint I have is that the shape of the wand can be a little awkward when trying to raise it for cleaning off the floor level (but this may be a case of me being impatient).This is a very good vacuum cleaner, excellent for business use and good for home use if not being used on cut pile carpet. It has excellent suction, it's quiet, and it has good range with a long cord that is sufficient for most single rooms. It is much better than the average vacuum cleaner and will serve the user well.

5.0,"Strips Perform as Expected If You Follow Directions, Don’t Exceed Weight","In my experience, 3M makes the best adhesive products.  If you follow the directions, they will generally do whatever the package says they'll do.  These COMMAND LARGE PICTURE HANGING STRIPS (14 Pairs, White (PH206-14NA)) consist of adhesive-backed Velcro.  For them to hold framed pictures effectively, without dropping the pictures, you must use enough of them to carry the total weight of the framed pictures.Two pairs of Large strips are necessary to secure an 8-lb. picture; four pairs are needed for a 16-lb. picture.  You must remove any hanging hardware from the picture; clean the wall and frame area; apply the appropriate number of strips to the picture frame and position it on the wall; peel the picture off the wall; press down on the strips for 30 seconds; wait one hour for the adhesive to achieve its maximum “hold”; and then reattach the picture to the wall.  After that, your picture should hold on the wall as expected.If possible, I always use something like these strips for hanging pictures, clocks, etc., to avoid putting nail holes in the wall.  However, if I have something really heavy to hang, I get someone to install it professionally with wall anchors, or with hangers nailed to the studs.  There are limits to the amount of weight that adhesives can support, especially if the adhesives—like these—can be easily removed without wall damage.I like these Velcro strips much better than the putty-type hanging squares.  They’re nicer-looking, and easier to install.",2018-06-05 19:43:31.363,0.0,False,Industrial_and_Scientific,en,positive,0.662431001663208,0.8208779096603394,[],5.0

5.0,"Not optimum for cymbals, but great for toms","Up front: if you are looking for mallets that you will mainly use on cymbals I recommend the Zildjian model that has yarn heads.I purchased these because there a few songs in my band's setlist that require mallets (the most prominent one is Blue Bayou.) My toms are configured with Remo Coated Ambassadors, and the small, dense heads on these mallets give a nice tone when the toms are tuned medium high. Perfect for the songs that I perform.The beater heads on the mallets seem sturdy enough, but since I am using them for four songs, and am not gigging much these days I cannot be specific regarding longevity.Having a dual purpose mallet that can be flipped and used as a stick is a nice touch, but frankly not a feature that I much use. I am adept at switching between mallets and sticks, so it's moot. However, while the ""handles"" are thicker than I would use for drumsticks, they are pretty thin when compared to other mallets. Factor that into your decision.The feature that drew me to these mallets, and why I personally rated them so highly, is the small, dense beater heads and the tone I get from them. Very staccato, but you can still control the dynamics.",2022-07-08 21:13:25.864,11.0,True,Musical_Instruments,en,positive,0.8328521251678467,0.6797676086425781,[],5.0

4.0,Good all in one package,"If you are looking for a one stop shop for guitar polish and fretboard oil, then give this kit a try.  It comes in a nice plastic container and has polish, fretboard oil, a microfiber cloth and a pick. Everything seems to come with a pick these days.As other reviewers have said, it's not clear what the contents are of the polish and oil.  The bottles both point to a website that says the products are out of stock and provides no list of ingredients as promised.  I'm knocking off a star for that because you should know the ingredients.  The fretboard oil bottle, which is only .5 ounces, says 100% Natural Oils, and that could be anything really from linseed oil to vegetable oil.  It should be lemon oil, but then the standard for lemon oil is Old English, which is mostly mineral oil with lemon scent, but at least they list the ingredients on the bottle.I used both products on a very old 12 string acoustic guitar that has seen better days and they both worked well.  The microfiber cloth is also very nice, it's thick and is 12"" square so it's a great size.Overall, the package is good and is about the same price as the Music Nomad kit which has the same items in it.",2022-07-21 22:39:49.838,0.0,False,Musical_Instruments,en,negative,0.4175699055194855,0.9377313256263733,[],4.0
4.0,Almost perfect - the headsets are the weak link,"I purchased this as a home rehearsal system, as well as a back-up for the Audio-Technica system I use for gigs. Since there are a number of detailed reviews already I will keep mine short and to the point.First, the weak part is the headsets. They are uncomfortable and if you wear glasses they are also not optimal, nor are they easy to adjust. However, I have to give the microphones in them a lot of credit because they do sound good. I did not try the lavalier mics and do not intend to since I do not use those. I do wish the headset from my Audio-Technica system would fit the body packs that come with this one because I would purchase two of those to replace the ones that came with this kit.The receiver is truly nice. It's fairly easy to set up and configure despite the poor instructions, and the ability to run it off batteries is a plus for some folks. I do not foresee me using batteries, but I know musicians who have battery operated amps and PAs who would love that particular feature.Sound quality is very good bordering on outstanding, and the overall value is darn good for what you get. If this came with the same quality headsets as those with my Audio-Technica I would give this a solid five stars. If I had to doit all over I would have invested in a second Audio-Technica set, but that is my personal opinion. I cannot fault the sound quality, and if you need to play where there is no electricity, this is hard to beat.",2016-04-27 15:27:37.000,1.0,True,Musical_Instruments,en,negative,0.6200477480888367,0.5671852827072144,[],3.0

The latter is a fluffy beater with a cork center that is perfect for jazz. This one has more projection and is more staccato than the Bomber, but is well suited for playing off the head versus burying the beater for music that still requires some finesse.At 7 7/8 inches long this beater works with all of my bass drums (I own 18"", 20"" and 24"" kits) and can be adjusted to strike off center for any of them. It will work to hit dead center with most pedals if you prefer that as well.For me this is perfectly suited to smaller venues where you do not want a bass drum that overwhelms the venue. I play heel down and lightly and it's more than sufficient for smaller coffeehouse gigs, and especially lightly amplified gigs. If you need a beater that will work with jazz, roots and Americana and blues (and possibly alternate rock) this one is worth checking out.

The arm is quiet, the covers work well to cover the springs, and it holds my Samson Q2U in place without issue.Next, the meh. The base of the mount is plastic, and with that, there is a wobble (see video) when adjusting the mount, which is not something I'd expect at this price point.Another issue is with the base clamp. While the clamp itself is sturdy and padded so as not to hurt your desk, there is an ""overhang"" (maybe for use as a headphone holder?), which severely limits where you can put the mount. As a result, I couldn't put the mount on either side of my desk (my preferred location, and instead had to put it in the computer bay at the front.Overall, this isn't a terrible arm, and if you can get past the issues I mentioned above, I'd recommend it.",2022-10-22 21:08:52.492,0.0,False,Musical_Instruments,en,positive,0.5364599227905273,0.942245602607727,[],3.0

4.0,Best for live playing; not good for recording,"I purchased this mic for a recording project. It is more omni-directional, even when close mic'ed, than I expected. So for recording it is not a mic that I would recommend. For live playing its pretty good. The problem in my case is I play mostly acoustic, unmic'ed so I don't have much of an opportunity to use it where it is best suited. I did extensively test it in my home studio and it very nicely picks up snare drum nuances, and especially when I am playing with brushes.Among my favorite features is the very clever mounting system that attaches to metal rims and some wood hoops. If you are planning to use it with wood hoops on a snare drum they have to be the straight style, not shaped hoops like Yamaha and some earlier PDP hoops.  In fact the clamp comes close (but not quite able) to affix to a bass drum hoop,  I also love the sturdy carrying case, and the interesting way that the mic uses a floating type mount system to hold it in place to minimize noise. Had this mic been more uni-directional that would be the perfect mount to use for recording.Finally, the price: this is an absolute bargain if you are looking for a semi-pro quality snare drum microphone for live playing. In that scenario I highly recommend it over SM-57 and other commonly used mics.

5.0,Built like a tank and high quality all around,"I purchased this to connect two TC Helicon Vocal Singles pedals together. Be aware that the size is not quite accurate.

The connectors are excellent quality, and the strain reliefs are the beefiest that I have seen on any cable. And it is a true 16 gauge AWG, so despite the size weirdness, this is one of the highest quality XLR patch cables I have ever used.In my application it is totally noise free, but I do need to point out that if you are planning to use this on a pedal board, it takes up a lot more real estate that I thought it would. I am not complaining because it fit mine, but do take into account that the 2.5 and 2 inch ends are extended to 3.5 and 3 inches respectively when the strain reliefs are factored in.",2016-05-29 13:45:25.000,1.0,True,Musical_Instruments,en,negative,0.39072033762931824,0.8352214694023132,['XLR'],5.0

2.0,not that great,"I got this with my Casio WK-200 keyboard as a package, along with a stand and headphones.Maybe I was expecting too much. Or maybe it's because I've used a real piano with a real pedal, and I can't help comparing it to the substitutes. Or maybe it's my keyboard's fault.I just don't think this pedal is that great, and I'm surprised it has so many good reviews. I don't think it sustains that well and notes fade very quickly. You can tell that a pedal is being used, but it's not very....strong? I'll take it over nothing though.The pedal consistently moves backward as your pressing it with your foot so you have to constantly stop and pull it back under the keyboard again. The plastic material they have lining the bottom isn't very grippy. I need to find a way to fasten it to the floor in the right place somehow, or else I'll never be able to play a whole song through with the pedal without having to stop and re-place my pedal. I'm sure placing the keyboard against the wall would help it from moving very far, but it'd still move back and you'd still have to fix it.",2012-01-10 00:25:25.000,0.0,False,Musical_Instruments,en,negative,0.4788961708545685,0.5820105075836182,"['good reviews', 'substitutes']",3.0
5.0,Great for Beginners & Non-Professional Musicians!,"About a year ago, I bought my teenage daughter a cheaper, no name keyboard. It was in the $80 range. She plays the cello, ukulele, and guitar and wanted to learn how to play the keyboard. She had a lot of complaints with the keyboard and lost interest in it after a short while. I thought maybe she would have more success with a brand name keyboard instead. And so far, so good. The sound is so much better. The keys don't sound as plastic as the other keyboard. They still don't sound like a real piano, but it's definitely much better than the cheap one. This one has more features, sounds/voices, and more than the other keyboard. The power adapter doesn't come with it, but the old one didn't come with one either. The specs for the adapter are on the description page, so my husband was able to find one at home that works. This keyboard is perfect for beginners or hobbyist players. It would probably not suffice for professional musicians, but it has been quite good enough for my teenager and has gotten her interested again in learning how to play.",2017-06-20 13:59:56.449,1.0,False,Musical_Instruments,en,positive,0.4595531225204468,0.9747161269187927,"['range', 'ukulele', 'plays']",5.0

The blue tooth connected immediately and so did the microphone. We didn’t read the instructions because it was very easy to use without. The sound is very clear and loud. We had it set at about half and progressively made it louder as the night went on. It did not distort as it was louder. This is very heavy and bulky so the wheels are essential. I wish the remote was larger as I am afraid that we will lose it at parties but I think that I will velcro it to the side.

5.0,Definitely a bargain for weekend warriors and folks who manage their own gear (not roadworthy),"I purchased this to accommodate a [[ASIN:B0035JI8J8 Boss ME25 Guitar Multi-Effects Pedal]] and a [[ASIN:B008O0RKVA TC Helicon Mic Mechanic]][[ASIN:B008O0RKVA TC Helicon Mic Mechanic]]. Both of those fit nicely, along with an [[ASIN:B00RBBRJYQ Elivebuy® 5-Port Desktop Smart USB Charger + 6 Outlet Home/Office Power Strip]]. Even with the morass of cables that such a rig entails I was able to get everything into this case with a little room to spare.As others have mentioned the weak link is the Velcro strip, but I knew that going in. I plan to not only get a beefier one, but to glue it down over the felt part of the case. That means I am going to get a two-part length of strip (top and bottom), but am still shopping around for that. As it is, the pedals and power strip I have in the case is snug enough that the stuff will not bang around.Even with the relatively tall power strip and wall warts for the Mic Mechanic and ME 25, the top cover fits. There is some give in the cover's ample foam padding, so I am sure that is part of the reason why stuff is not rattling around. I was a little about that, but my concerns have been assuaged and I am pleased.There is one thing I do not care for and that is the hinge assemblies. They can get stuck removing or replacing the lid. On the other hand, there are strap buttons (similar to a guitar's buttons) that allow you to add a carrying strap if needed. My gear is so light that it's moot, but the feature is there.Overall, this is relatively lightweight in construction, so for the constantly gigging musician it is probably less than optimum. For weekend warriors and those of us who are playing locally and manage our own gear, this is an inexpensive way to get a decent pedal case. I am so pleased that I am purchasing a second one in the near future to house our keyboardist/vocalist's damper pedal and a small array of vocal pedals.",2016-06-01 17:42:00.000,4.0,True,Musical_Instruments,en,positive,0.6716508269309998,0.9126578569412231,[],5.0

5.0,Great for stage and studio,"I received this as a free review sample. The tuner is the heart of this device, and the metronome is good enough for most musicians.What I love about the tuner is it has a very easy to read display and ability to run an electric instrument into the input, and out again to an amp. Or just in to tune. It also has a built in microphone for acoustic instruments. In addition it has modes for all chromatic instruments, guitar, bass, violin and ukelele. It allows transposition in the chromatic mode for instruments like saxophones. You can transpose to C, Bb, Eb and F. You can also transpose ukeleles to C or D using this feature.Another tuning feature that this has is the ability to set an A4 tone to any frequency between 410 and 480Hz. So if you are among those who believe that A4 should be 442 Hz versus 440, this tuner will allow you to set that as a reference tone.The metronome has a wide range of BPM settings, as well as a tap feature for setting beats. What I love is you use a dial to quickly get to the BPM setting. My older metronome used buttons that were clumsy for changing BPM values from one range to another that were widely separated. You can also adjust the beat value up to nine beats per measure, which can be a limitation for some musicians. For example, I can use six and still practice to 12/8 tunes, but would not be able to practice to an 11/4 tune like Whipping Post. Of course, for 99% of the potential users this is probably not a real limitation, but I need to point it out.Finally, there is a learning curve to this device. It is not complicated, but you navigate by button presses of the mode and function buttons and it does take a few hours to become accustomed to those.Bottom line: this is one of the nicest tuners that I now own, and it includes a decent metronome as an added feature. It's compact (although not as compact as clip on tuners that many guitarists favor.) However, what it lacks in compactness it makes up for in features that go over and above single-purpose tuners. Plus it's accurate because I tested this against two other tuners I own and all three were spot on.",2015-07-18 08:49:21.000,14.0,False,Musical_Instruments,en,positive,0.912604808807373,0.6974495053291321,"['amp', 'metronome', 'good', 'musicians.What', 'love']",5.0

I am very pleased with the overall construction, and especially the connectors. Those are the weak points of many budget cables. These are perfect fits on both the male and female ends. They insert and release with no issues.The outer jacket of the cables seem thick and they are flexible. The material is somewhat soft, so I would be careful if you are using them outdoors and dragging them over rough surfaces like concrete. Otherwise, I cannot find a single thing wrong with them and will purchase additional cables from this brand as needed.Bottom line: do not let the low price scare you away.

5.0,Light and sturdy,"I purchased this specifically for placing a Carvin XP800L powered PA mixer at a convenient height and it is perfect for that role.Here are the dimensions if you are wondering if your laptop or other gear will fit: The shelf is 15.3 x 12.2 inches and you can adjust the height from 32.3 to 52 inches. Note that this has a maximum weight capacity of about 33 pounds, so it should accommodate any laptop and quite a few powered mixers, projectors and similar devices.The shelf can adjust to just about any angle and holds as long as you do not exceed the 33 pound load limit. My Carvin is only ten pounds and will not budge when I hand tighten the friction nut. I also like the lip around the shelf that keeps my mixer from slipping off when I slightly tilt it up to access the knobs more easily. If you are using a laptop there are cutouts so that it will not interfere with your typing on smaller keyboards.This is also relatively light, weighing in at a little over 9 pounds. It folds relatively compactly, so is easy to transport.

All the genuine case candy, inspection tags, Fender play. The most striking thing is that this guitar shipped tuned and perfectly intonated. Pickup height wasn't really adjusted, but that's more a preference thing than a playability thing. I was worried the 12"" radius would be hard to navigate with my small fingers, but the rolled edges and polished frets REALLY ease playability and I already love this guitar.

5.0,Almost identical to the John Riley stick/mallet model,"If you are on the fence about whether to purchase this or the John Riley stick/mallet model, there are the similarities and differences:Similarities: both are .551 inches diameter x 16 inches length, and both have very hard, felt mallet heads.Differences: this model has a slightly larger felt mallet head than the Riley model, and the tip is ball type (versus the acorn design on the Riley model.) This one works well for cymbal work, especially if you want a defined stick; the Riley is better at rebound.Personally I prefer the Riley model. That does not make it better or worse - it's my own preference and I am sure that at least fifty percent of those reading this review will prefer the opposite. I have owned the Riley model for about twelve years and since I use them perhaps on twenty percent of my gigs, and them for maybe a song or two they have held up nicely and I have every reason to expect the same from this pair. To realistically provide a lifespan I have about 60 hours actual use. That is based on 1500 gigs since I've owned them, of which 20% is 300, multiplied by 12 minutes (two six minute songs) is 3600 minutes, which is 60 hours.As for the difference in the mallet ends, to me the sound and feel are so close that I would not be able to tell the difference if blindfolded.

2.0,Junky,"I ordered one of these (from MF) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work.  Even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case.  But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing.  As for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed.  The other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case.  The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag.  It also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you).On the positive side it's light, it does fit a Telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment.  But do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better.

First, I must admit I am a 50 something technically challenged woman (often times), so maybe it was just me. I easily was able to download the apps and get it to work with my IPhone. It was cool asking Siri to turn it on and off. I really wanted this for Echo and Alexa. Try as I might, I couldn't do it. I downloaded Wink and synced Alexa with Wink. And then synced IHome with Wink. Could not get Alexa to find the smart plug at all (and I spent hours today on and off trying to do this). I will try again tomorrow. However, I will tell you nothing is easy with this. I found no instructions for use with Alexa in the package and had to surf the web for solutions. Seems like a lot of work to be able to simply turn on a light with my phone. Also, I could not get Siri to do this remotely (while I was out and about), so I assume it only works if you are in the proximate area for programming.

Long story short, he was very dismayed to have to find a replacement.  After several weeks and research, winding down options to about 1/2 a dozen backpacks - he chose this one.  He reports a few things...PROS:  1.  it's well made - well above the price. And a long shot from the cost of the over expensive backpack that was stolen.  2.  It's roomy.  3.  Everything he needs fits.  4.  There are a LOT of compartments - they sort of fan out when all open.CONS: None.... unless you consider his opinion as a &#34;con&#34;....  It is entirely possible you could overload it and make it very, very heavy....A couple of further notes.... he has not evaluated the charging aspects of the bag.. there are spots you can pull a USB cord through to attach to your devices...

I find it works better with my frankenquest adapters at holding things in place than the stock foam. It bounces on my face less ands doesn't require as much tension.2. This does seem to work better at keeping my face cool that just the silicone covers for the stock foam.Negatives:1. There is still a bit of light bleed out the sides, but it's not bad unless you are in a really bright room and you can only tell in dark scenes. I have seen other adapters including side cushions to repair this issue.2. The nose piece doesn't stay on well, and when it does it presses hard and leaves a mark on my nose. It's still rubber so it's not painful, but there has to be a better solution. Maybe cut it lower or make it a bit more flexible.

5.0,Great SLR camera for the money,"Ok, so let me preface this by saying that when I was in my 20's I owned a great SLR camera and dragged it around with me everywhere. I even used to take a load of pictures at rock concerts, had interchangeable lenses, a variety of lenses... well, you get the 'picture'. I was a 'professional' amateur. Flash ahead to the 1990's and on, I have a family and start to look for new gadgets. I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability. I loved the fact that I could slip these cameras into my pockebook and pack up the kids to the park (without a huge camera bag). Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR. Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel. All I can say is 'wow'! I love it, love it, love it. Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself). The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time. I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again. I have also gotten into wildlife and nature pictures and some of the pictures I have taken of flowers could match up with any professional photographer. If you are in the market for a compact SLR, this is the camera to buy!",2011-05-01 22:41:06.000,17.0,True,Electronics,en,positive,0.6878830194473267,0.6954796314239502,"['pictures', 'load', 'rock', 'variety', 'professional']",5.0

2.0,Couldn't get it to connect to my router for wireless control.,"This is a good price for a starter kit of 5 devices.  The program you install on your Smartphone is easy to install and looks like it works as intended.  Here's the problem I encountered.  Every time I tried to connect to my router I would get the message ""Only supported on 2.4 GHZ Wifi Networks"".  My router is dual band and I believe it broadcasts WiFi both in 2.4 and 5 GHZ.  Apparently these devices are not seeing the 2.4 GHZ and are looking at 5 GHZ and aren't able to connect or the Smartphone is connecting at 5Ghz and the device won't pair with the phone unless it is connected via 2.4Ghz.  I contacted support and they gave me this answer:  ""You will need to connect your mobile device to the 2.4Ghz Wifi for the app to connect to the devices when they are in the pairing modes. If you are unsure how to connect to the 2.4Ghz of the dual band router, you may need to log into the router to either turn on the 2.4Ghz WiFi or rename it so you know which connection is the 2.4Ghz. If you are unsure how to do so, you will need to contact your router manufacturer for assistance. Alternatively you can pair the devices via AP mode as indicated in the manuals of the devices.""  I don't know how to make the necessary changes in my router to be able pair the smartphone with the 2.4Ghz connection and I didn't want to take the time to learn how and potentially mess up my router and/or the way the Smartphone connects to my router. (It seems like I would need to change both.)  I tried the AP Mode that support mentioned, but it still would not connect; it would fail every time.  The whole setup seems just too complicated.  Also, they fail to tell you that at least on the water sensor, you have to twist open the device and remove the paper tab that prevents the battery from making contact, before you can set it up.  Am disappointed and surprised that no other reviewers had the 2.4 vs. 5 Ghz issue.  Not recommended unless you know all about how to set up your smartphone and router to connect at 2.4Ghz or unless they already are.",2019-06-30 23:13:20.338,0.0,False,Electronics,en,positive,0.44278332591056824,0.5842970013618469,['intended'],3.0

ROKU has these station right on their screen you do no have to search and the searching for stations is not easy on Amazon. I just went on my Roku TV and do not have half the commercials on News max and my favorite stations. I could go on and on never thought Roku was smarter than Amazon. Now I know Amazon does not like us to see some stations. I am a huge Amazon fan they get lots of money, I buy 90% from them. But their Fire TV stinks.

As is typical, always supervise when the baby is using this and sterilize before first use.This is made in China. The current price of $12.34 ($12.99 minus 15%) is reasonable for this if it came in a two-pack as that would be $6.17 each. However, as a one-pack, this is about $7 more than others are being sold for. Overall, I consider this a great teether and the baby is less likely to drop this.

5.0,Perfect for travel and visits for Grandma!,"I specifically ordered this stroller at the advent of my grandson coming down to visit me in Florida for two weeks. And it couldn't have arrived at a better time. First, let me tell you I am a very technically challenged 50 something year old woman. This Graco Breaze is a breeze to put together! I love the maneuverability of it, especially considering getting around tight places. I took him to Disneyland and used this exclusively. The rotating wheels handled the ins and outs of crowds like a charm. This unit is lightweight (in other words, easy for me to carry) and folding it up with one hand makes it extra easy when you have a child in tow. I also love the features of the cup holders and the pockets for storage. The seats are cushioned and the canope top kept my little grandson out of the harmful Florida UV rays. I always have loved Graco products (in fact, I purchased one of the Play yards for him to sleep in when he visits. They are made to be durable, long lasting and hold up to a lot of abuse. This stroller will probably work well for him for the next couple of years being that it can hold up to a 50 pound toddler.

Anyway, I stopped using it and started several times a week getting my BP taken at the stores. When I saw this innoHaus monitor I thought I would try it to see if the technology has improved over the years. To my surprise this wrist device is smaller than the one I had previously and is incredibly accurate. Whether I take it one time, wait 20 seconds and retake it, the results are consistent.

5.0,"Iconic Protein Drink, chocolate truffle","I am having some major surgery coming up.  My doctor recommended a different drink (3 a day for 5 days before surgery - and 3 a day for 2 weeks after). Only problem is the protein drink he recommended was HORRIBLE.  The 5th ingredient is anchovy paste!!  It was truly awful and a hundred bucks for 12 drinks!  So, I asked if I could sub out the awful, super expensive drink for these Iconic drinks.  He agreed!  I ordered the Iconic chocolate truffle, the caffe latte and the vanilla.  Do you like chocolate milk?! Who doesn't, the chocolate truffle tastes like the best chocolate milk you've ever tried!  When I drink the caffe latte I pour it over ice or blend with ice and it's like a really terrific iced coffee!  The vanilla bean is as delicious as it sounds. And they all SMELL good too. Honestly.  All of this, without anything that is bad for you and 20 grams of protein!!  In fact my doctor says he will now recommend these drinks.  When you HAVE to do a meal replacement drink - you have GOT to try these first!  I am soooo grateful for them - for taste and cost!  Plus they are shelf stable!!!  So refrigerate as you need them!

5.0,LIFTING HANDLE ON THE SHREDDING HEAD IS A REAL PLUS,"The best feature of this shredder is that it has a handle to lift off the shredding head so you can easily empty the bin.  I have always struggled removing the shredding heads and have nearly dropped one a few times.  The handle only requires one hand lets you get a good grip on it and makes it so easy.  Shredders are noisy in general, but this one is reasonably quiet.  It has the added feature of a slot for CD/DVD shredding and you can also shred plastic credit cards.  I didn't try shredding 12 sheets that it is supposed to handle.  I noticed that most shredders work a lot better if you don't try to use them at full capacity.  This does seem powerful enough to do 12 pages at once, if you want to do that.  Amazingly this comes with a complete 12 page manual, explaining the features of the shredder, maintenance, trouble shooting and warnings. There is also a separate one page troubleshooting guide.  These days manuals are a rarity, so I think that is a real plus.  Well designed machine.  So what's not to like?  Even though this is a crosscut shredder the pieces are a little bigger than with my prior shredder. It still does an adequate job of shredding, but would have liked to see smaller pieces.

5.0,What Seemed to be the Oils Final Push,"In 1993 remember fondly waiting for this album to come out.  The radio station I listened to, 93.7, The Coast, WKOC (Norfolk, VA) told me of its release.  This station wasn't known for following the herd or leading ""Sheeple,"" it was ahead of the curve.My first listen to Truganini sold me on the album.  It told me the Oils weren't yet done with their work.  It told me offenses still waited to be set right.  It told me they, at least, would try to raise the conscienceness of a self engrossed people who generations earlier thought nothing of wholesale slaughter of others in the name of European white men and differences in the color of one's skin.I don't know how I knew at the time it also signaled the end of Midnight Oil outside of Australia with only the album Breathe to follow in 1996.Sadly, the Oils never received the worldwide success they so honestly deserved.  Hopefully during the years after their disbanding people occasionally think of the good they did through their music.  Yes, it was political.  Yes, it made ME think.

4.0,"Not exactly Hollywood, but a high energy jam session in nearby Inglewood","This album was recorded mere weeks after Chet Baker and Bird were 'home recorded' at the same venue. Like that album - [[ASIN:B005MVLS94 Bird & Chet: Live at the Trade Winds, 1952]], the sound quality on this one is not spectacular, but the music is. In fact some of the same musicians from the earlier session are on this one.Sadly there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review. In a nutshell, this is mainly a horn-centric session with a young Chet Baker playing a lot more aggressively than he would on subsequent albums. There are two tracks where the ensemble downshifts and gives Al Haig a lot of room and places him in the front line: I'll Remember April and Sweet Georgia Brown.Here are the tracks:1. There'll Never Be Another You2. Bernie's Tune3. My Old Flame4. Avalon5. I'll Remember April6. How High The Moon7. Sweet Georgia BrownIf you love energetic music this is a great album. It was recorded live at the Trade Winds Club in Inglewood (a Los Angeles suburb) on August 4, 1952 and features the following line-up:Chet Baker on trumpet with Ted Ottison on trumpet on tracks 5 and 7, Sonny Criss on alto on tracks 1, 3 and 7, Jack Montrose on tenor sax on tracks 1, 4 and 7, Les Thompson on harmonica on track 4, and a rhythm section comprised of Al Haig on piano, Dave Bryant on bass and Larry Bunker on drums.",2013-10-19 10:58:03.000,4.0,False,Digital_Music,en,neutral,0.43657806515693665,0.8959513306617737,[],3.0

I actually opened an account with iTunes and Spotify so I could hear more of their music and so far, I haven't been disappointed. In fact, I'm rather addicted to the music.I don't really know much about them except that they are made up of 2 vocalists and 5 dancers which is an interesting set up to me, but apparently is something of a standard with the company they are affiliated with. Outside of that, I don't know much more about them except that their songs are top grade pop-dance-r&b music. The really good stuff that makes you want to smile and move. &#34;Evergreen&#34;, which is on this CD, is about as good a pop song as I've ever heard. I can imagine that 10 years from now, it'll sound as good then as it did on the first listen. Other songs on this CD are solid. I really like &#34;Loadstar&#34; and &#34;Gimme!&#34; but I have the softest of soft spots for &#34;I Believe In Miracles&#34; which sounds straight out of 1977 and I mean that in the best way possible.It doesn't look like their CDs and/or DVDs are available from Amazon US except via third party sellers and thank goodness, the third party seller that I buy from is super reliable and I'm quite happy with them. Generations from Exile are available on Spotify and iTunes so if anyone wants to check them out, that's a good place to start.

And its rewards are commensurately grand.This rendition features excellent singers in all the three leading roles — Tokody is superior in sound and manner to the late-captured Price whose voice (if were a barge) would sink.  Unfortunately, she failed to fine the voice down for her Angelica in the sister recording. But Casellato-Lamberti is the equal of Domingo and Nimsgern is excellent. Even the Frugola is cast with a real voice instead of a crone’s. Prêtre is completely convincing and the sound is spacious and well-captured.

5.0,Like a 'best of' from her Verve large orchestra albums,"It's hard to dislike this album, although there are better deals that document Anita's Verve Years. For one, I would go with [[ASIN:B005I4UMCO 8 Classic Albums]], which is slightly more expensive with a lot more tracks. However, this album contains some true gems.Since as of the date of this review there is no track listing for this album I am providing one (and their source albums).The first seven tracks, plus track 23 are from her 1958 album titled [[ASIN:B000WLVBBE Anita O'Day Sings The Winners]]. They are: Take the A Train, Early Autumn, Four Brothers, My Funny Valentine, Sing, Sing, Sing, What's Your Story Morning Glory, Peanut Vendor and Star Eyes.Track 8, Whisper Not, is from one of my favorite albums titled [[ASIN:B000V697T8 Anita O'Day And The Three Sounds]]. Sadly this is the only track that is from that amazing album.Stomping at the Savoy and Don't Be That Way (tracks 9 & 11) are from [[ASIN:B000V6728Q Pick Yourself Up]], while Hershey Bar (track 10) is from [[ASIN:B001NZJ3HW Cool Heat]] and Peel Me a Grape (track 12) is from [[ASIN:B000VRH2IU Time For Two]] (another album I absolutely love and wish was better represented in this collection.)Tracks 13-21 are from [[ASIN:B000WLQKHO Swings Cole Porter]], consisting of Just One of Those Things, Love for Sale, Easy to Love, I Get a Kick Out of You, What Is This Thing Called Love, Night and Day, Get Out of Town, I've Got You Under My Skin, and De-Lovely. Somehow the producer managed to include every one of my favorites!Interestingly, the next-to-last track - Honeysuckle Rose - is from her first Verve album, [[ASIN:B00000470I This Is Anita]].Overall, this is a solid collection of Anita's Verve years, and are drawn from albumsnext-to-last that are more centered on orchestral arrangements and backing (two exceptions are tracks 8 and 12.)

5.0,Previn's jazz chops are in evidence here,"This album is yet another of my thrift shop finds. The mystery is on the cover it's credited as Piano Solos With Instrumental Accompaniment. I took that as a challenge because there were no hints in the liner notes as to who was backing him. I pretty much suspected Red Mitchell on bass and Shelly Manne on drums, but beyond that had no clue. I managed to track down the dates and personnel on each track, which I will provide below.First, you can listen to the tracks on a larger compilation made up of albums and tracks from the same era: [[ASIN:B008FTAH2O Previn's Touch]]. Run through the sound samples and you will be treated to a display of Previn's jazz chops. Although he had the touch and feel for classical, and the innate sensibility for sound tracks and scores, he was a first rate jazz musician, but his other work (and the fact that he was in the West Coast scene) overshadowed that. This album is evidence that he was the real thing in jazz too.Here is the track list, which is missing at the time I am writing this:A1  Flying Down To Rio  2:30A2  You Are Too Beautiful  3:19A3  When You Wish Upon A Star  2:05A4  London In July  3:25A5  Moonlight In Vermont  3:18A6  Island In The West Indies  3:29B1  How Are Things In Glocca Morra  3:43B2  It Could Happen To You  3:03B3  Honolulu  2:51B4  My Foolish Heart  2:11B5  But Beautiful  3:11B6  Sidewalks Of Cuba  2:24It took some sleuthing to discover who was backing him. All of the tracks were recorded for the Decca label in Los Angeles in April 1955 and March 1956. Here are the sessions and musicians in chronological order:April 1955 has Previn backed by Al Hendrickson on guitar, Red Mitchell on bass and Irv Cottler on drums:Track B1: April 11.Tracks A1,A4 and A6: April 13.Tracks A5, B3 and B6: April 18.March 1956 has Previn backed by Al Hendrickson on guitar, Carson Smith on bass and Shelly Manne on drums:Tracks B2 and B5: March 28.Tracks A2, A3 and B4: March 29.This album was released by Decca as DL 74350 in 1963 and clocks in at 35:35.

5.0,A Warning About Sunshine,"Jung Ho Seok aka J-Hope, Hobi, *literal* Sunshine has been holding out on us.I mean, the signs were there, if we cared to look: BTS is perhaps the most extensively documented band in modern history, and there are plenty of glimpses of Hobi irked and maybe a little sad, but only when the cameras are focused on someone else. But he, and probably Jin, carry an outsized share of the positivity weight.But this is what happens when you keep turning that little crank on the side of the box. Keep winding. Go ahead.It all comes down. All of it. And it's not all pretty. Although, let's face it: Ho Seok is one of the prettiest humans ever to walk the planet. I digress. Sorry. What I mean is - Jack In The Box has moments of delicate beauty. Equal Sign and Future are lovely, the first for humanity in general, the second for one special love. But there's a conflagration going on. MORE and Arson in particular hit you hard with sides of Jung Ho Seok that J-Hope keeps mostly hidden.It's all out now, though, and it is freaking glorious.MORE is a straightforward headbanger. Arson stays closer to hip hop. But they both FEEL great. Ho Seok's got a gift for rhythm and sound - his lyrics are percussive and convert information more by how they feel than by what they are overtly saying. The beats and embellishments are divine booty shakers. You get the message because you listen to the songs over and over - they feel that good even though the tone is dark.Well, in fairness, Arson is both dark and blindingly bright. The album's closer ponders whether, now that everything is on fire, he should put it out or let it burn. You can decide for yourself, but it seemed to me like he decided to pour gas on it.",2022-07-15 12:52:35.983,15.0,True,Digital_Music,en,negative,0.7256946563720703,0.749506950378418,[],5.0

The full moon ensemble takes old traditional gaelic music and makes it into modern love songs.

Track seven, Take Her In Your Arms will take your breath away! And it's just my current favorite,subject to change when track eight comes up.In some songs the fiddle is dominant, in others the vocals stand out, in most there is a nice interweave. Beautiful guitar supports and does not detract; and - a difficult conception in this age of overmixed drums - in none of them does the rhythm section lose  control.

5.0,One of finest Trovatores from a great era of singing,"Wagnerians look back to the 50s and 60s —Verdians acclaim the 70s justifiably. Evidence lies in this live capture from 12/18/77 led by the redoubtable Muti, and studded with stars such as Cossotto, Manuguerra, Carlo Cossuta, and in very good broadcast sound from the 2000 seat Teatro Communale. At the head of the ledger is a soprano who is hardly remembered despite starring at the Met for some 158 performances, where she was much appreciated  — simply because she was not invited to make any commercial (studio) recordings.What we hear is a voice of lustrous beauty throughout its range (which could hardly be said of many of her rivals such as Price and Scotto); exquisitely fine-grained despite it ability to expand to spinto power, and a technique of flexibility and accuracy (she tried to sing what “è scritto”, and sometime Muti is unforgiving as he’s used to Leonoras who smudge their fiorature).  One hopes that when a Mexican soprano anywhere near this calibre appears, the studios will have changed their attitude.So the three key reasons for acquiring this recording (also available on at least one other release) are Cruz-Romo, Cossotto (in typically wonderful form), and Muti (who does not allow any interpolated high notes by the tenor). Carlo Cossuta is quite fine as Manrico (certainly better recalled for this rôle than Otello). Under no circumstances can Muti’s later release (in modern studio sound), with its superannuated principals be considered at all competitive to this rendition.It’s ironic that the Trovatore recordings that give me the most respect for the opera are both live recorded with superb Leonoras: Cruz-Romo and Caballé (a different characterization).  I would not dispute another Amazon reviewer of this recording issued on a different label who has called this the finest Trovatore on disc.",2020-12-29 02:38:29.962,2.0,False,Digital_Music,en,positive,0.8613932132720947,0.591815710067749,[],5.0

5.0,"If these marches don't get your blood moving, I don't know what will!","There are in essence two types of wind music.  The first type is comprised of Baroque brass music and transcriptions, especially by Gabrieli, and the purpose is for worship.  The second type is comprised of military marches the purpose of which includes celebratory but principally for the purpose of keeping cadence for marching troops.  This 2-disc album is of the second type and features Herbert von Karajan leading the Brass of the Berlin Philharmonic (plus some other wind instruments).  Now, for the purpose of this review, please join me in suspending any political overtones there might be in some of these pieces and their possible use in the past by the German Army of WW II.  I am speaking only to the music itself.If you love band, wind ensemble, or brass music, then you will love this album.  Each march is superbly played.  I am a veteran myself, and I frequently became aware of an irresistible urge to get up and start marching!  A few were composed by Beethoven, Johann Strauss and Johann Strauss the Elder.  One of my favorites is the Florentine March by Julius Fucik.  I first heard it on a Frederick Fennell disc.  The march that concludes the album is the well-known Radetzky March.The marches were recorded in 1966 and 1973, but the sonics are pristine.  The recording venue for all was Berlin's Jesus-Christus-Kirche, so the recording has wonderful ambience.  There are no real criticisms that can be levied against the music with the minor exception that Karajan was obviously never a marching soldier, because he strays occasionally from the strict tempo that military marches have at their very foundation.  He is actually trying to make music!  The nerve!These marches are performed superbly and the sound is stellar.  It is absolutely enjoyable from beginning to end.  This one gets my highest recommendation.  Forward March!",2014-04-27 16:07:56.000,5.0,False,Digital_Music,en,positive,0.3718617558479309,0.7538204789161682,[],5.0

5.0,"Not essential, but a gem for Davis fans","I love this album mainly for the collaboration between Milt Jackson and Miles, but I have to give due credit to McLean's contributions too. Not only is his playing masterful, but Dr. Jackle and Minor March are his compositions. Ray Bryant contributed a composition as well: Changes. The remaining track is a Thad Jones composition that somehow got slipped into the track list.At the time of this review there is no track list on this product page, The album clocks in a scant 31 minutes with the following four tracks:01 Dr. Jackle02 Bitty Ditty03 Minor March04 ChangesRay Bryant is another reason why I love this album. I own a large number of his albums and his playing here does not disappoint. Credit is also due Percy Heath on bass and Art Taylor on drums, both of whom make definite contributions by staying under the music and supporting it. Taylor is one of my favorite drummers from that era simply because he could play any groove and do so unobtrusively. He manages the same here and is locked in with Heath to give the melody instruments a foundation.The album was recorded in a single session at Rudy van Gelder's Hackensack, NJ studio on August 5, 1955 and released the next year by Prestige as PRLP 7034.

It is crisply sung, almost doo-wop. It never loses its poise or falls into cliche.Most of these songs were hits. If the titles don't jar your memory, listen to the samples. Expect to know at least 10 of these.A couple weak links are present in ""Treat Her Like a Lady"" and ""Error of Our Ways."" In these two songs, there's no funk, no soul, and no depth. Both are acceptable, as pop R&B, but are musically pallid when compared to ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" and ""Ball of Confusion.""The liner notes provide a puffy history, and credits song-by-song. That's not why this is worth buying. It is the sheer cool class and sway of the Temptations greatest hits. A couple songs might be left off, but most are here. Be sure to find the best price.1.

4.0,"A gentle, relaxing yoga practice","As the title suggests, this 60-minute practice by Stephanie Keach consists of a gently flowing series of yoga postures. Performed entirely on the floor, the poses offer a combination of restorative work and mild stretches. Stephanie starts you off in a supported cobbler's pose (using a blanket as a bolster), where she guides you through some basic pranayama (yogic breathing) work. Removing the bolster but continuing to lie on your back, you will perform knee hugs, hip opening work (including half dead bug pose), and a reclined twist. Next it's on to hands and knees for cat rolls, child's pose, and cobra, working up to a flowing series which seamlessly combines these three postures (Stephanie's study under Kali Ray is apparent here). Moving to a seated position, Stephanie performs neck rolls, a simple seated twist, cow seat, and then full cow pose (unfortunately, you may find that your upper body is not sufficiently warmed up for this posture). The final seated posture is head-to-knee pose using a strap; Stephanie has you flow in and out of this pose several times before holding it wherever you are able to do so. Returning to lying on your back, you will work your abs with knee drops and then perform bridge and crossed leg twist. Finally, Stephanie sets you up for a long (about 10 minutes) savasana, with only the sound of gentle music playing in the background until a soft bell calls you to finish the practice.This video reminded me very much of Rainbeau Mars' Pure Tranquility, partly because both practices are performed entirely on the floor, and partly because Stephanie's teaching style is very reminiscent of Rainbeau's, particularly with her frequent focus on the breath. Stephanie also talks about our overactive ""monkey mind,"" encouraging you to let go of thoughts and to concentrate on your body instead. Overall, this is a very nice, calming, relaxing practice accessible to all levels of yoga practitioners.",2007-08-14 06:38:56.000,3.0,False,Digital_Music,en,positive,0.5905078649520874,0.6305742859840393,[],5.0

1.0,"Kevan Strawberry licorice laces, 2 pounds","I love licorice shoe laces. I was so excited to receive these, until I opened them.  Something happened to them.  They are tightly wound and them apparently heated somewhere, some how.  They are 1 giant brick.  I was not able to peel off any more than maybe 4"" of a couple of laces that literally pulled and pulled with all my strength.  It's just a giant brick of too tightly packed laces.  As I mentioned I believe they were heated somewhere some how because they were just solidly glued together!  As for the tiny piece I yanked off, it was a little tart, a little strawberry.  Overall, I of course, will not order again.  The brick went into the bin.  Sadly, it was not edible.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

They make me much more comfortable bringing nicer rods kayak fishing.These can get in the way, though. The foam stays in place better on the thicker Ugly Stik, but it still slides enough to become annoying. The velcro to hold the foam in place also catches the line every few casts. My solution to both the sliding and velcro catching was to use zip ties instead of velcro. They can cinch the foam down much tighter, and depress the foam enough that they won't snag the line.If your rod has a hook keeper, than can also get in the way. In theory the Ugly Stick should have had tons of clearance between the line and the foam. Due to the placement of the hook keeper, I had to put the foam much closer to the bottom eyelet than I would have liked. That would be a problem for most floats of this type, though. A bouyant butt cap would interfere less, but presents its own issues when using rod holders (e.g. on a kayak).Overall, I think these are a great option.

This is a very attractive looking chair and the leather does seem to look high end. The chair is comfortable seating and the arms are ergonomically placed for maximum comfort.

Although I was able to do it, it took me almost an hour to do as I found the instructions difficult to follow. It may be me, so I hate to deduct more than a star in the rating, but I think assembly could be clearer and easier to make this a more quality chair. Also, the fact that there is no adjustable lumbar support could also be a downside.

Making desserts and pizza were two of the things that I couldn't wait to try when I got home. I first used the Emile Henry baking stone for pizza and I really loved it. The thin crust I made came out crispy and evenly cooked (475 degrees), my sons loved it. Only complaint I had was that it is not the easiest item to get in and out of the oven (especially when it is fully heated). First time I tried it, I found it heavy and almost impossible to get a good grip on (especially with baking mitts on). Stone also retains heat for a good amount of time (keep that in mind if it is summer and you take it out of the oven to cool). Second time I used it was kind of like a quasi-cookie sheet. I made biscotti which requires to bake the cookies twice (first time in a lengthy roll of almost 12 inches, second as sliced in cookie slices). I only had the oven at 350 this time and the size of the stone was perfect and the cookies came out delicious. I do highly recommend the stone for anyone looking for an extra tool in the kitchen.

Whiter and lighter skin is much better to them than being darker, so this mask is bragging about its skin lightening abilities so the user will have lighter skin. Therefore, looking more white and being a more attractive person. I think that's disgusting. I sure as hell don't support it.

5.0,chair leg covers,"We just installed a bunch of new vinyl flooring where carpet had been. So, instead of the plastic nubs that help you slide on carpet, you need to switch to the felt based tips.  We've been through a whole passel of felt squares - our chairs have 1 1/4"" square legs.  The felts with the stickers just slide off and never stay in place.  I never tried the ""tack"" on or screw on types for fear of harming my floor - and then we found these!  These are a really good design.  They are different than other silicone sleeve with the felt squares only at the bottom... those slip and tear the silicone, eventually coming off.  SO FAR - these have stayed in place perfectly, without slipping.  Key is that the felt square rounds UP the side of silicone sock.  Slides A LOT better across the floor as you're sitting on the chair than any of the other stick on felts.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

I tried an ace bandage wrap on his body last year and it didn't do anything so I was skeptical.

5.0,Worth getting.,"Out of all the third-party controllers out there thus far, this one is my favorite, despite it not having vibration. I wound up getting both the gray and gold (GameStop exclusive) colors. I have this one, the PDP, and the official Nintendo one (I also plan on getting the Hori one), and I've been using this one the most. In many respects, this definitely is the WaveBird 2.0.The build is pretty good, though the shell is made of pretty thin plastic compared to an original GCN controller. The PDP controller feels a lot better than this one. Also, with the silver and gold variants, the color is actually painted on; when I removed the battery cover I could see the clear shell underneath the paint.The buttons all feel really good. The analog triggers have less travel, which is fine for me. The two Z buttons have a more tactile and audible click, which also is welcome. They have slightly more travel than the original controller, which may also help with tactile feedback. The shape overall seems pretty much the same, and the rest of the buttons feel the same as well.The gates around the sticks, however, are higher, which to me is a lot better than the original, especially when it comes to games like Smash. What this means is that there's less travel for the sticks, making moves tighter and faster. I'm not sure how this bodes with platformers as I've yet to try that (should get Odyssey shortly), but for games like Smash it works great.The convenience factor alone makes the price tag worth it. Yes, it's more expensive than the original, first-party controller, but you get more colors, Switch-specific buttons, and wireless connectivity. There is no vibration/rumble, sadly, but if you've grown accustomed to using the WaveBird then you'll find no frills here.

4.0,"Dear sweet Charlotte, please come back....","I've played nearly all of the 28 Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive; my favorites of all time were [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]](due to the great creepy voodoo vibe and goth prince Harry), [[ASIN:B0018XU9SQ Nancy Drew: The Phantom of Venice]] and [[ASIN:B0041CASX2 Nancy Drew: Shadow at the Water's Edge]]. I loved the combination of culture, history, and mystery in these games.In Ghost of Thornton Hall, Nancy is called upon to find Jessalyn Thornton, a missing bride-to-be on Blackrock Island, ancestral home of the Thornton family. Thornton Hall is a dilapidated antebellum mansion flanked by skeletal moss-draped trees and a crypt / graveyard. Like CRY, you'll spend the entire game at night, which means lots of dark lighting (and ambiance). As other reviewers have pointed out, GTH felt a bit like a mashup of [[ASIN:B003BHGWMY Nancy Drew - Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and Legend of the Crystal Skull (missing bride-to-be + lots of time spent in graveyards / crypts).You'll spend much of the game untangling two separate mysteries: piecing together the puzzle of the missing bride-to-be as well as the death of Charlotte Thornton, whose ghost is said to haunt Blackrock Island. Nancy has the chance to interrogate several members of the Thornton family, although I would have liked to see more actual snooping (there's definitely much less snooping than in earlier games...and where do these people sleep / eat since no one apparently has a room at the house?).You're limited to three main locations; I would have liked a couple of extra rooms to explore within Thornton Hall (one humorous random ND moment: there's a tea set where you can make yourself unlimited tea, and then I realized that this was one of the few games without a bathroom!). A few more hotspots would have been nice, too (Jessalyn's purse is on the floor, but you can't explore it. Wait, shouldn't there be some evidence in there??). However, there are lots of animations and unexpected surprises that add some life to the creepy old mansion.SAW and CRY are definitely two of the spookier games in the series, but GTH has a sustained spookiness that pounces when you least expect it. Creepy events happen in every room at any moment, and combined with the eerie music (which has a great vocal / cello soundtrack), keep you on the edge of your seat. For me, the biggest cop-out was the supposed explanation for these at the end of the game...which wouldn't have explained all the sightings anyway. The game was morbid more than scary; there are several surprisingly dark subplots and possible endings for an ND game, and several of the conversations involve some pretty black humor on the part of one character in particular.The puzzles offered sufficient variety, but I would have liked to see more use made of the ghost hunting equipment that Savannah Woodham left for Nancy; it's pretty obvious that the hauntings are off the charts, but you only use it for one puzzle and then you're done (SAW was great about using EVP recorders and the like to try and capture evidence).If you're stuck, you can use the hint feature if you're playing as an Amateur Sleuth. Another cool touch is that there are three possible endings depending on how you play out the final scenario. It was fun playing through all three to see the different endings, which also added replay value. One feature that I liked was that you can instantly see which awards you've earned throughout the course of the game using the new trophy menu display; each time you earn a new award, you'll get a notification (there are A LOT of possible awards this time around, adding to the replay value).

5.0,A great game that brought back a lot of fond summer memories,"I used to take riding lessons as a kid, and even now I can still remember the excitement of caring for and riding such wonderful horses. &quot;Horse Illustrated: Championship Season&quot; is as close to the real thing as you'll get: you get to groom, feed, tack and ride four different horses depending on skill level. On top of caring for your horse, you also have the option to watch several videos on equine care, first aid, and riding techniques. As if that wasn't enough, the game has a scavenger hunt and a trivia game as well.There are three different types of riding challenges: dressage, cross country and show jumping. There are four skill levels based on accumulated points (earned by completing the scavenger hunt, correct trivia answers, caring for and riding your horse. The courses become more difficult as you progress. The scenery is varied for each course and the music is pleasant enough. The four horses each have different strengths and personalities and respond a bit differently to each jump. There's even a commentator for all three challenges. The controls were easy to master and the highest difficulty level still eludes me, so there is plenty of learning curve and opportunity for replaying &quot;Championship Season.&quot;The barn area was very well conceived--I could practically smell the hay and horse manure in the summer heat. The lounge area had a fridge, microwave, VCR and cupboards full of things to explore. The tack room had several saddles, bridles, and books to read, and in the feed room you get to sort out the exact amount of the proper feed (hay, corn, alfalfa) for your horse. You also clean stalls and water the horses. There are five stalls, the last occupied by a goat. Each horse has its own colour (Barney=red, Blaze=blue etc.) as do the stalls and bridles.This is a great game for kids (or adults!) who love horses and teaches some basics about horse anatomy and care, grooming (including how to braid manes and tails), and stresses regular feedings and stall cleanings. Perfect for the child that begs for a horse...this teaches some degree of responsibility about how much work is involved in caring for a horse.",2002-03-24 17:46:24.000,19.0,False,Video_Games,en,positive,0.7432747483253479,0.9828344583511353,[],5.0

3.0,&lt;Loading...> Initial &lt;Loading...> impressions. &lt;Loading...>,"(For some reason my review keeps reverting to the PS4 version, even though I delete and resubmit under the Switch version. This review is based on playing the version for the Switch.)CTR was the first game I ever 100%'d. Even for years after, I tried my darnedest to unlock Nitros Oxide, refusing to believe all the confirmations out there that he just wasn't unlockable. My sisters, dad, and cousins would play this game non-stop for months. I still have my original copy, and purchased it on PSN for my PS3 and PSP. This is the only game I have to get on all possible systems (besides Plants vs. Zombies). So I was pretty freakin' ecstatic when they announced a remake.First, the loading times. They are awful. I was talking to a co-worker about the game this morning and he said he was reading reviews that the game was great but that they mentioned the long loading times. I didn't believe it, but I was wrong. They occur when you load up races, and at the beginning of the story mode. They sort of kill the enthusiasm. I had heard that they're not that bad on other systems, but on the Switch it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before every track. Definitely needs to get fixed. I can see myself bringing this to friends' houses only for the loading to create a buzzkill.Once you get past them, though, you can actually play. And here's my other biggest problem: the hopping. I can't play CTR without the boosts. I've played MK8D and TSR and I'm always drifting and boosting, and it's all thanks to CTR when I played starting 20 years ago. I don't know what it is, but the jumping doesn't feel the same this time. Either the jumps are too high or they're too long, but they're definitely floaty. I'm actually able to change the direction mid-air, which I don't recall doing. I played the original to confirm, and the jumps definitely are slightly longer/higher here than in the original. In the original, the characters feel a wee bit heavier, which is far better for power sliding.Subsequently, I'm not able to time and complete my boosts as I was before. I really hope I'm wrong and it's just me being a bit rusty, but if it's not the same then I'm going to have to change the way I play this game.Now, as for the positives, I love the extra content they added without really detracting from the overall experience. The visuals are beautiful, and they've added things here and there to the tracks without really changing them (e.g., Coco's track has a statue of Coco, Crash Cove has a sculpt of Crash, etc.). I played CNK back when it released, but don't really remember it. I really like that they added the CNK tracks and the other character; there were a couple of CNK tracks I remember but the characters I don't recall at all. Still, a nice touch.The customization really worried me when they announced it, as I had thought it would change the driving mechanics, but not so. In kart racers like MK, there are way too many customizations and I can never find one that feels right (and by right I mean one that drives like CTR). Here, the customizations are purely cosmetic, which I more than welcome. Each driver is the same from the previous iteration, and the little changes to the character and kart are just for show.Thank goodness.Here's hoping Activision/Beenox updates the loading times for the Switch and, if necessary, the jumps. Right now, the jumps need to be either lower or shorter.",2019-06-24 15:01:59.815,3.0,False,Video_Games,en,negative,0.4843766987323761,0.9808494448661804,"['delete', 'resubmit']",5.0
4.0,Teenager approved- lightweight with comfort!!,"Ordered for my son who’s both particular and a bit hard on equipment.. The FANTECH headset passed the test which says a lot coming from one of the tougher critics- a Teenager!! I anticipated he’d find something to complain about- So, Imagine my surprise when he didn’t!Worn over the crown with a ratchet mechanism this truly does create a personalized fit.. This is more then adequate for a larger size head with even room to spare- and my son has an unusually larger head (so yes!! It will fit an adult as well.) Best of all, bc of hollow cut out design and materials used- this is beyond lightweight which is so helpful!! This doesn’t a sore neck/back due to heaviness after wearing for a longer length of time.Ear pieces are large enough to encompass the entire inner ear and with almost 1” of “moldable foam” to act like a sealant.. it shuts out the outside noises while being comfortable as it’s worn. The sound is solid.. For my son he’s not a stickler for the perfect iconic surround sound in a gaming headset. But, he does expect high quality and clear ability to hear teammates voices while gaming over everything else.. and so far, this sound quality hasn’t let him down! Removable mic. Is a perk if not playing with a team.. it helps keep it safe/out of way when not in use!This has a solid but nicely bendable cord to connect into gaming controller.. it provides plenty of slack so user does not feel as if placed on a tight leash! Connections stay strong and in place with no loose fit.. and if sound does fail, don’t forget it may be inside the controller! (I mention bc, it happened to us!)For a $30 price point this is a solid headset we use on the PS4 system. This has provided comfort and quality for a decent price.

5.0,Award-winning for a reason,"Galactic Civilizations II Ultimate Edition is the latest and best installment of the Galactic Civilizations series, packing in both currently-available expansion packs in addition to the base game. It is a turn-based strategy/conquest game, allowing play to stretch out over days or even weeks. There is a lot to this game, but once you get the hang of how to play this game it is very much worth the time and effort.To be very clear, this is a turn-based game, not a real-time strategy game or a first-person shooter. If turn-based games do not appeal to you, look elsewhere. If you have not played a turn-based game in the past, it is a different experience from most other games on the market in that the planning and strategizing require thinking in a different way, and this style of play is not something everyone enjoys.One of the very first things that a player will notice about this game is that the graphics are absolutely stunning. Stardock put an incredible amount of effort and care into the interface, from the menus to the cut scenes. Everything is smooth, seamless and, well, beautiful.Although the graphics are well-done, the interface is exceptionally complex and busy. The player manages almost every conceivable aspect of the game -  economy and tax rate, research direction and funding, relationships with other civilizations, planetary production, fleet composition, trade and more. It is very easy to get lost in the sheer volume of options available.Gameplay starts with several choices, most importantly race but certainly not the only option. Victory conditions (more on that shortly), universe size, star cluster density, frequency of viable worlds, number of other civilizations, and a few other options are all specified at the start. After making all of these selections, the player gets a single planet, a colony ship, a survey ship and an asteroid miner.Every turn consists of a number of important choices. The player decides how to allocate all of the resources available and takes steps to better their position, with the ultimate goal of meeting the victory conditions specified at the start. This may include exploration of space junk (there is frequently much benefit to doing so), colonization of a new planet, or perhaps cranking up the tax rate. Once all of the desired options have been selected, the player ends the turn and a new turn begins after all selections have been executed.One of the most interesting aspects of the game is in designing new ships for the fleet. The player gets to pick hull type, armament, sensors and everything else a ship needs to be a successful contributor. Once a design is complete and named, any starport orbiting the player's planets can build those ships. It is important to keep in mind that some designs may not work well through the entire game but that sometimes a design should be retired in favor of new, more advanced designs.Gameplay continues until victory conditions are met. There are several conditions that can be specified - military conquest, diplomatic victory (peace treaties with all other major civilizations), technological victory (done through research) or even a cultural invasion.Every choice a player makes affects something else within the game. For example, higher taxes can cause a planet to mutiny and join a different civilization. More important, though, is how choices affect relations with the other civilizations. Most civilizations pay attention to ethical alignment and military might, and depending on how strong or weak a player's civilization can even incite a war. Finding a good balance is the key, and finding that balance is inherently tough.As this version comes with both expansion packs, there are three campaigns that are available for play. I have not tried any of these so I cannot really comment on them.This is a very engrossing game with slick graphics and many, many choices for the gamer who wants absolute control over every aspect of the game. If this style of play is appealing to you, seriously consider picking up a copy for yourself and say goodbye to your free time.",2009-04-16 09:28:14.000,38.0,False,Video_Games,en,positive,0.8560680150985718,0.9952665567398071,[],5.0

5.0,The game is afoot!,"Frogwares' seventh installment of Sherlock Holmes is absolutely stunning. With incredibly lifelike modeling and rendering (you can practically count the pores on characters faces), a wide range of immersive environments with real-time effects (blowing leaves, running water, etc.), and plenty of intrigue to keep both Holmes and Watson busy, the game most certainly is afoot.Crimes and Punishments is not a linear story; rather, it is made up of six separate games loosely connected by the appearance of the Merry Men, a gang of terrorists. Several of the stories are taken from canon (Black Peter, Abbey Grange).As you play through the first case, on-screen guidance explains the gameplay basics. As Sherlock, you have several tools at your disposal, including a research library of encyclopedias and newspapers, a laboratory where you will be required to perform different types of chemical analyses, and Toby, the best nose in the British empire. You also have a full wardrobe of potential disguises including a makeup table; this will be of importance at several points in the game. At certain points, you have the chance to switch between Sherlock and Watson, a constable, and Toby, the “best nose in the British Empire.”There are several new features here from previous installments of Frogwares’ series, including Sherlock's mind palace, where you visually connect glowing synapses as new clues are unearthed, leading you to a series of possible conclusions as to the culprit(s). Depending on the conclusions you reach, various suspects will be pronounced guilty. Sherlock then has the additional responsibility of deciding whether to arrest or absolve each killer. Another feature is Sherlock's in-depth analysis of characters; you have the ability to slowly pan over each suspect, and Sherlock points out various facts that will enable you to unlock key plot points based on these observations. Sherlock also has two additional tools in his arsenal; one allowed you to observe details that others would miss (this is accomplished through a filter than also distorts background sounds), and the other allows you to mentally recreate an object (this is a mini puzzle in itself as each “mental object” requires manipulation to function).The locations range from grimy London alleys to Roman ruins, elaborate Chinese temples, and stately manors. Each felt totally unique and distinct from the others; in fact I was floored by the attention to detail and number of explorable areas as other detective games I have played give a much smaller venue.  In addition to puzzles (which range from frequently easy to very difficult), there are a series of mini-games that involve boxing, archery, chemical analysis, recreating objects, and a whole lot of lockpicking. These mini games can be skipped, which will drastically shorten the length of the game. It’s also obvious that the mini games were designed with console gaming in mind, as accomplishing some of them on a computer keyboard (without a joypad) is pretty much impossible, but I was able to accomplish most of them successfully.I found the length of the cases to be a bit uneven; for example, the first, second, and fourth cases felt shorter in comparison to the other three. I also felt the second case was the weakest of the six as the locations all felt extremely repetitive and I had deduced the basic plot very early into my investigation. The disguise feature is a great idea, but it seems to only have an effect at a couple of points in the game; it would have been interesting to see how suspects and NPCs reacted to Sherlock depending on his outfit at a given time. I would have also liked to see greater weight placed on the morality system; you are notified if you made the correct deduction, then told what percentage of fellow Steam gamers made the same judgment call. Once you make a final decision, the game erases all save points for that case, so if you want to see various endings, be sure to do so BEFORE accepting the final decision.There are also a number of awards that can be earned for accomplishing various cases, conversations, and minigames, which adds to the replay value.Voice acting was generally excellent, with dialogue that felt true to the characters and the period. The banter between Sherlock and Watson (and Sherlock's jibes at Lestrade and his brother Mycroft) felt true to the original stories. Even Mrs. Hudson makes an appearance, as do the Baker Street Irregulars and Bill Wiggins, who play a key role in several of the cases.Fans of BBC Sherlock, the original Conan Doyle stories, and detective novels in general (especially if you are a fan of the older Agatha Christie PC games as I am) will find much to recommend Sherlock; the graphics are simply stunning, the environments are totally immersive, and the replay value is high as there are so many potential outcomes, optional clues, minigames, and awards to earn. This is truly one of the best and most impressive PC games I have played in the last decade.",2014-12-03 22:33:02.000,10.0,True,Video_Games,en,negative,0.5795031785964966,0.9852209687232971,[],5.0

There is a 5 mouse comparison on the bottom of the item description page that has 5 pictures of mice.

3.0,Inexpensive Headset Designed to Enhance Role-Playing Experience,"The best thing about this PDP TITANFALL 2 OFFICIAL MARAUDER SIX FOUR COMMUNICATOR (for PlayStation 4) is that the jack plugs directly into the controller.  It's super easy to install and doesn't need batteries.  It's reasonably comfortable to wear, considering that it consists of a microphone, and one small, on-ear, left earphone attached to a plastic band that goes over the top of the head.  (In my experience, this kind of headset usually begins to hurt after a while). There is a volume/mute switch attached to the cable connecting the headset to the jack plug.The inexpensive headset is primarily intended to enhance the TitanFall role-playing experience through a player's use of &#34;official&#34; equipment.  As the brochure packed inside says:&#34;Marauder Six Four communicator is designed and developed by East Lexington Ironworks and customized to be used by Pilots of the Militia SRS ground and air personnel.  This wearable audio unit allows bi-directional voice communication in a robust but compact enclosure.  Noise canceling ECM field microphone is rated for 110dB (roughly the surface dB threshold of a Vanguard Class Titan drop at 3-5 cubits away) as the pilot will be heard loud and clear even in the most intense situations during an engagement.  SRS Marauder Six Four communicator is compatible with Titan cockpit controllers and will securely fit and adjust to different head gear while it is recommended to use it along with chin strap or helmet attachments for personnel who are equipped with Jump Kits.&#34;",2017-01-02 21:45:47.000,0.0,False,Video_Games,en,positive,0.7281202673912048,0.9767172932624817,[],5.0

I often hear him having to ask customers to repeat what they've said because he cannot hear them clearly. The other day, I heard him yell a phone number to a customer  because the customer could not hear him very well thanks to the microphone on his headset. He's now using NUBWO's gaming headset and is much happier.  It fits well and is comfortable. Both are important seeing as he wears the headset 10 hours a day. Its easy to operate thanks to the attached in line controller-volume, microphone and LED light are all controlled by it. Background noise is also filtered out which is a very good thing because our puppy has a loud bark and he cannot risk customers hearing the dog while he's helping them. The included USB plugs into his compute and has sufficient cord length.This headset has made his job a bit easier for him, thankfully.

4.0,Easy to Set Up,"I am not a fan of a lot of modern video games, especially first person ones. I'm in my early 50's and I like the old games that have simpler graphics. They don't cause motion sickness to me! My family, however, are all fans of video games. I did give this a try though. First, it was easy to download the game.  The design/appearance of the game is fairly stylized and cartoonish. They aren't trying to be realistic as far as the characters go. My husband was the first to play it. There isn't a lot of guidance, so he was just trying it on his own. The game works by using the included gun. He couldn't figure out how to pick up a found weapon. It was too new to find anything online, so he gave up. However, later our 21 year old son played it and he didn't have any problems getting the new weapon. Finally, I gave it a try. It didn't make me feel sick to play, even as I roamed around the ship. I found it was easy to point and shoot. In fact, I thought it was easier to use than the Nitendo Duck Hunt game of many years ago. The game itself is okay. You go around a cruise ship, shooting zombies. There is blood and gore, but since it's cartoonish, it's not too bad.  It did seem a bit repetitive in the short time we played. It seemed to start over at times. Of the three of us, we did enjoy the playtime, but none of us have gone back and played it again. That could be because of busy schedules right now.",2019-11-25 00:28:04.547,1.0,False,Video_Games,en,neutral,0.5603878498077393,0.5973603129386902,"['early', 'fan', 'sickness', 'download', 'stylized']",4.0

4.0,Excellent sudoku game for most players,"Sudoku puzzles are a fun distraction and many, many people have jumped on the bandwagon. Even some newspapers have started including Sudoku puzzles in their daily publications, and bookshelves are lined with book after book of Sudoku puzzle collections. Being unwilling to buy an endless supply of books, I picked up this Sudoku program, which came with a Kakuro program as a bonus.This Sudoku program is user friendly, pleasant on the eyes, and it does not annoy you with incessant chatter and distracting tunes. The interface is straightforward and clean and it allows you to just play your game - it stays out of your way and it is there to offer help when you want it.It does have some helps it can offer. You can get pencil hints, or you can check for errors. These hints come at a price, though - this particular Sudoku keeps score based on your solve time, and every request for hints reduces your score appreciably.There are three difficulty settings, from beginner to hard. The hard setting will challenge the average player but a strong player may find it to be insufficient in terms of difficulty. This is typical of most Sudoku programs though. There are definitely better programs out there if getting really hard puzzles is the goal. The beginner setting is very appropriate for anyone just getting started, though.I tried the included Kakuro and I did not care for it. The implementation was fine and it was similar in design to Sudoku, so the problem was not the application. The problem is that I do not like Kakuro as a game. I cannot blame the game manufacturer for that.If you want a good Sudoku program that has a pleasant interface and a good supply of puzzles, this is a good choice. It is priced right, it is a straightforward implementation and it has a very nice interface. If you happen to like Kakuro too, this program is for you. Sure, there are much more challenging implementations of Sudoku and if that's what you need, then take a look at some of the other offerings, but this one is an unbeatable value for what you get.",2007-10-30 12:49:50.000,0.0,False,Video_Games,en,positive,0.4513871669769287,0.935522735118866,[],5.0

4.0,Gabriel Knight III an interesting mystery....,"This is the first ""Gabriel Knight"" game that I've played, and I'm definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series. ""GKIII: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned"" had its moments of brilliance.The characters were well developed, with distinct personalities. The voice acting, however, ranged from decent to shame-on-you bad. Case in point: Tim Curry as Gabe Knight. His accent seemed to shift wildly from Southern to...something unidentified. Hall of shame nominee: Scottish thugs proclaiming: ""We're Scots, God help ye!"".The graphics were generally detailed, but pixellated. 3D models had a tendency to cut in and out of the screen.There were plenty of places to explore in the chateau, museum, church, and town of Rennes-le-Chateau, and in the surrounding countryside. The puzzles were often difficult, and I frequently found myself backtracking for missed items. Also, there is a lot of downtime in some of the timeblocks so I found myself wandering around for a while trying to kill time.The storyline was genuinely unlike anything I've ever played before. Although the initial premise is that of a vampire cult kidnapping a child, the ending drastically reinvented the story of Jesus, which is sure to offend many. I *still* don't understand half of the cutscenes and ending months after playing it.There was a lot of dialogue to sort through, and many locations that I had to backtrack through, so this game kept me busy for quite a long time. ""GKIII"" is not for everyone's tastes, hence the M rating. It deals with vampirism and a reinvention of the death of Jesus.

4.0,"Nearly flawless, but flawless for RPGs.","The Hori Digital Controller for the GameCube is one of my “grail” controllers. For over a decade I've casually eyed this controller, seeing its price rise from high double digits to what it is now. Still, I don't think the price is that bad for such a unique controller. I love it when companies take their own, fresh perspective on standard controller layouts without making them unwieldy. Comfort is usually the driving force for change, as well as quality-of-life improvements. 8BitDo has been doing a fantastic job in this regard, and now Retro Fighters isn't far behind.Retro Fighters (“RF”) is doing wonderful things in the controller world. My first controller was the Brawler64 when it came out in different colors. (While I was aware of the Kickstarter, I avoided it out of personal reasons with Kickstarter itself.) It was love at first touch. It perfectly conformed to my hand and felt wonderful. The d-pad could use some refinement, but overall it's great. Fast-forwarding through a bunch of controllers, we arrive at the BladeGC. I knew I had to have it. Initially, I thought 8BitDo would release a controller like this, or at least some other company, so I was super excited when Retro Fighters announced it. Though I'd still like to get the Hori one some day, it's no longer a must; it's wired and doesn't have features for modern systems. Let's list the upgrades:- grip- analog sticks- two more shoulder buttons- vibration- Switch/PC buttons- wireless (and 2.4 GHz to boot!), with both a dongle for the GameCube and one for USBAlready this is the perfect upgrade to the Hori Digital Controller. The little Z button is missing on the front, but of course it's not a requirement.I'll start with commenting on the d-pad. It's…phenomenal. I'm *very* picky about d-pads. Nintendo's of course are best, with Hori a close second. 8BitDo's may feel nice, but they have a habit of mis-presses. This can be remedied by opening the controller and applying binder reinforcement tabs; not ideal, but definitely alleviates the issue. But this d-pad? Damn… My thumb *skates* across it. When I first opened it, I was a bit disappointed with how it felt. It's low and has straight corners. But during play is when I noticed how marvelous it is. I tried Crash Team Racing, Stardew Valley, and Shredder's Revenge. Every input was precise and correct, and my thumb was able to just skate across it with speed and accuracy. Mein Gott.I haven't extensively used the analog sticks since I didn't get this controller for them, but I tested them with Smash. There's an octagonal gate for each stick, and each movement was comfortable and, for the time I spent using them, precise as well. They're smooth but don't let your thumbs slide off. The tops are flat, with the outer ring (textured for gripping pleasure) jutting up just enough to prevent thumbs from steering off. They don't have as wide an area to move as the GameCube controller, or maybe that's because they're not as tall, but they work well enough. Because of how wonderful this controller feels, I now plan to get the BattlerGC.The vibration is subtle. I'm unsure whether there's an option to change the strength, but the manual doesn't indicate that so I don't think so. It's not too low so as not to feel it; in fact, I think it's the perfect strength if you prefer a little feedback without it dominating the hands. I've had some third-party controllers that freakin' rattled the whole controller. Super uncomfortable. The BladeGC's gives you just a small jolt to remind you that you got hit, loser.And the wireless connectivity? A non-issue. Since this is not Bluetooth, it can't be used with the Switch when in handheld mode; instead, the USB dongle plugs directly to the dock. The Switch then reads it as a wired controller (which must be turned on in settings) and away you go. There is no discernible lag from what I noticed.Now on to the “bad.”Material. The controller is already light enough, but the quality of the plastic is very light and feels hollow. There is no grip texture. Rather, the whole thing is smooth and my hands can slide a bit easily. This is something I noticed with other RF controllers, so I know it isn't just this. Based on how it feels, it doesn't feel like a premium controller, though I certainly consider it one.Stick placement. There is little distance between the right stick and the B button. I have relatively small hands (5'8"", so whatever size hand that coordinates to) and haven't moved the stick accidentally, but I always feel it when pressing the B button. This made me wonder how people with bigger thumbs will experience the controller.But that's it. No more bad. Everything good. Oh, maybe the back shoulder buttons. I prefer ones that stop with a noticeable press, but these go just straight down like a lot of modern shoulder buttons. Gross. Maybe the sticks can be bigger too, but I'll wait until I try the BattlerGC to comment on that.This will be my main controller for RPGs, or any other game that utilizes the d-pad and A button a lot.B for materials and stick placement, A+ for everything else.",2023-01-31 19:19:45.824,3.0,False,Video_Games,en,negative,0.41001105308532715,0.8715298175811768,"['controller layouts', 'high']",4.0

4.0,A fun (if short) romp inspired by the works of Poe.,"""Warnings at Waverly Academy"" (WAC) is Nancy Drew's 21st adventure with HerInteractive. In WAC, Nancy goes undercover at Waverly Academy, a posh girls-only boarding school in New York. Some of the girls have been getting threatening notes from ""the Black Cat,"" which are then followed by malicious accidents. Nancy, as Becca Sawyer, has been asked by the school's headmistress to investigate.Unlike the previous installments [[ASIN:B001ANDJJU Nancy Drew: The Haunting of Castle Malloy]] and [[ASIN:B0026EV5FW Nancy Drew: Ransom of the Seven Ships]], there are five characters (suspects) that you have to befriend: Izzy Romero, Mel Corbalis, Leela Yadav, Corine Myers, and Rachel Hubbard. True, the girls fall into somewhat predictable stereotypes (the jock, the Queen Bee, the Goth girl), but they've been given distinct personalities with backstories.The first comparison that springs to mind is the benchmark of Nancy Drew games, [[ASIN:B0002ZALES Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor]]. The game is not nearly as long (or difficult!) as Blackmoor Manor. Other than the fact that both games take place in drafty Gothic buildings, there's really not much in common.The school grounds are compact and make for easy (if limited) exploration. Inside the school, you have access to about ten or so rooms during the course of the game, along with limited space outside. I would have liked to see more areas to explore, particularly outside (there's an inviting-looking gazebo I kept wanting to explore). The puzzles fit well into the storyline. There's some filler in the form of ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" puzzles; if Nancy wants access to a particular item, she has to do something for another girl first. But these puzzles fit well and are subject-related (a science puzzle, a math problem or two). You're also responsible for working in the school's snack shop (you have to do it at least once a (game) day or you get demerits).  You can die (there's a handy Second Chance feature) or get expelled (say, for pulling the fire alarm, too many noise violations, picking locks, or sneaking out at night), but it's smooth sailing for the most part.Even though Nancy has had plenty of techno-tools in her arsenal in previous games, WAC felt totally current: you keep in touch with the other girls via Twitter, there's mention of MySpace (called URSpace), and part of your job is to help with the school's website. HerInteractive even did a cool ""Watching Waverly"" Twitter soap opera before the game's launch (the Twitter script can be read at  twitter dot com/HerInteractive/watchingwaverly And the school has a ""website"" at warningsatwaverlyacademy dot com (the campus map got my hopes up that it would be explorable).Overall, WAC was short, but fun. You really get a feel for the girls, the school, and the mystery. The historical storyline tied in well with the overall theme. The graphics look great, particularly the character animations (special mention to the modeling of Rachel; I thought I was watching a movie during cutscenes, she was so realistic). The music was perfect without being intrusive. There's a fun Easter Egg that you can find (there's probably more), and references to earlier ND games (including the ever-present Koko Kringles). And there's not much in the way of scare factor, so this is a good choice for younger gamers (much less of an emphasis on the supernatural than Blackmoor or [[ASIN:B000V728P2 Nancy Drew: The Legend of the Crystal Skull]]).",2009-10-31 11:24:21.000,6.0,False,Video_Games,en,negative,0.6661132574081421,0.9656278491020203,[],4.0

The sisters become involved when Maggie, one of the sisters in the sisterhood finds that her friend from journalism school, Gabby, seems to be in trouble.

4.0,Pretty in prison orange,"all the authors know that when I write a review,it is an honest one. I have only 1 issue with this book and that is for me,there were too many characters for me to follow. Now mind you,that is not a bad thing about this book,it is something that I have always had an issue with...and with that being said,,I think Madison wrote another great book in the continuing story of Agnes and Eleanor,the funniest senior sleuths ever. Finally,after all their antics,they are sent to prison!! But it's not what you might think. Strange enough,this time they have not committed any crimes. They are sent there by Peterson to investigate the murder of a prisoner/hairdresser. The inmates in this woman's prison are ready to riot,thinking that a guard has committed the murder. The guards think it had to have been an inmate. The girls begin to ask questions when another inmate is murdered,but this one is a guards helper,and Is as well loved by both inmates and guards just like the hairdresser,so who would have wanted to kill them and why?, and who is the quiet timid girl ,that comes to the prison on the jail bus with Agnes and Eleanor? No one knows about the mission,not the warden,not even Andrew and Mr. Wilson the husbands.. Agnes and Eleanor find out what being in prison is really like,and learn the stories of who the other girls are and what got them in there. I really liked this book because it made Agnes and Eleanor,appreciate what they have on the outside...and yes,it's a fun read !!!

5.0,"Quirky, dark comedy, fabulous writer","This is, and will stay, a favorite book for me.  One of my Goodreads categories is ""quirky"" and only the best are recognized, because quirky can easily fall into ""dorky"" or ""jerky"" or ""malarky.""  Only the finest of writers can pull off quirky and Hartnett is one.  Emma is coming home because her father has a brain disease that will kill him, eventually.  Emma Starling was born with a ""minor"" ability to heal by the laying on of hands.  She left her little hometown of Everton, New Hampshire for Pomona College in California, graduated and got into medical school in California.  Emma's father Clive had been a poetry professor in the English Department of nearby Meriden College.We know early on that Clive started hallucinating, saw cats all over his classroom one day and his ensuing behavior and the scene he caused led to his early retirement. Clive's wife, Ingrid,  a librarian at the college, also oversees the care of the Corbin Mansion and the family lives in the caretaker house.  Emma's brother Auggie is a recovering drug addict.  Auggie and Emma are in their early twenties and are not close.  A couple of other key characters in this novel are the ghost of Ernest Harold Baynes, known as Harold, a former naturalist who died in 1925 at age 57 and Crystal Nash, Emma's former best friend, who is missing.Clive befriends Harold and is desperately looking for Crystal who was like another daughter to the family.  No one else sees Harold. Everyone else dismisses Crystal's disappearance as that of a junkie who didn't matter and is probably dead. Clive obsessively and persistently puts up flyers and goes door to door looking for her. Clive is a Black Sabbath fan and was formerly in a cover band.  He's lost this and, because of his littering public and private property with flyers and his eccentric behavior when he hallucinates animals, he is barred from a lot of places. Despite this sad fact, Clive's illness and the ways it makes him behave lend dark humor to the book throughout.  Meanwhile, Clive not too long ago had an affair that has caused much pain in his fourth and most successful marriage. Ingrid is struggling with the simultaneous desire to take care of him and to dump him.  Emma is furious at him.  Auggie is a bit hard to read.  He mostly plays video games.  That changes.Everton is culturally odd, with most of its money coming from a gun factory (the Corbins) and much of its fame from Harold, who always had a massive wild animal collection, most notably a fox called the Sprite.  Off to one side of town is an extremely private 26000 acre game preserve and complex of millionaire's homes.  In the center of town is the Maple Street Cemetery, which offers some information on the townspeople and its history throughout the book.  The author will admit that she channeled Thornton Wilder at some point in her writing, and as a former ""Emily"" in an eleventh grade production, I'd say this novel is very much a tribute to his play, ""Our Town"" in several respects.The problem with a good quirky book is that telling too much of the story also gives away the giggly quirky parts.  Unlikely animals is about a family, a community, a fabulous fifth grade class, coming of age, perception versus reality and learning that  reality is itself quirky.  It's about a hilarious community theater production, a less hilarious small town drug problem, a mystery (Crystal) and more. Throughout, unbelievably believable excerpts of Harold's 1920s nature writing and photos of him with Sprite, with bears and of his wife are included to add to the character of the Everton itself.  This is a totally complete, totally quirky, very moving and beautifully written and drawn/photographed book.

4.0,Original Story - Lots of Plot Twists!,"What Happened to the Bennetts is a very original story of a family who ends up in the FBI Witness Protection Program after an attempted carjacking goes very wrong. When a popular soccer mom and dad, son and daughter, living as --part of a neighborhood with an active social media presence and tons of friends-- disappear suddenly, it doesn't work quite the way the FBI anticipates. Citizen detectives get involved. The narrator is the father, Jason, coping with the fallout from the crime the family experienced and figuring out who to trust. A crime family is involved in what happened, but there is more to this than meets the eye. Scottoline makes the rather far out plot twists work, with characters that are engaging and ultimately some hair raising moments. A very satisfying read, but then -- I buy all her books. This is one that is very worth the read. I read it fast and could not put it down. And there are cute dogs involved. I'm a cat person but loved these dogs.

5.0,MY OPINION of Pros &Cons,"What a great book. Jenna and Abby are best friends and con artists and so are Ethan and Cooper. Although they are each other's competition, Abby and Cooper fall in love and get engaged. Jenna and Ethan know that they are attracted to each other but fight the attraction. When all four decide to do one last job before Abby and Cooper retire, tragedy happens. After Abby and Cooper die , Jenna and Ethan comfort each other and give in. After which comes a typical love story between two wanted criminals while they exact revenge on the person that killed their best friends. A lot more happens but that is the general idea.I adore the way this book was written. The plot was original, no sappy love story featuring characters that separate because they refuse to communicate and later reconnect. This was a full on true love story with strong, intelligent characters that didn't let anything or anyone get between them. Not parents, villains or the law. It's hard to explain but it was that good.Finally, the last couple of chapters...a true ending/epilogue. Everything was wrapped up. After investing in such a good story I loved that the conclusion wasn't rushed. That takes true talent and shows that the book was written by an author that loves to read.I believe in five star ratings if earned.

She met his mother quite by accident when Mrs. Bates was protesting for women's votes in Washington, DC and they became great friends. Lizzie is supposed to stay out of her old man's and half brother's ways, but she gets caught up in doing good by conning bad people, without remuneration for her. In City of Shadows, the ""mark"" is a con artist herself, a post WWI medium who cons wealthy widows and gold star mothers into investing their money in ""sure things"" that will never materialize. Lizzie's family initially won't get involved helping her, because of a code among con artists but soon, multiple, intricate cons involving out of town specialists, inexperienced but talented ""extras,"" a fake office with Harriet, who answers all the fake phone numbers on fake business cards, culminating in a dramatic and oddly believable spur of the moment con that satisfies.

5.0,Historical Fiction at its Best,"Gilded Mountain is a masterpiece of historical fiction, bringing alive the very early labor movement in the United Staes even featuring a cameo appearance by Mother Jones. Sylvie Pelletier, child of French Canadien immigrants, travels with her mother and siblings from Vermont, to a company town in Colorado. Her father works for Padgett Fuel and Stone Company as a quarryman. It is 1907. Why have they traveled to this remote collection of rough cabins, eight miles up a treacherous, icy mountain road from ""the prettified coal town of Ruby"", then on past the town of Moonstone, with a store, a church and a jail to Cabin 6?Manning brings alive the grim reality of life in a company town. Workers are often paid in scrip. They receive no pay for the many hours they are required to work to keep the road clear or for any time they are expected to work beyond their shift. The work is hard and they have barely enough to pay rent and buy food. This is a marble mine with virtually no safety protocols.  Moving slabs of marble is dangerous work and accidents, including deadly ones are common. There is talk of a union. Sylvie's father is one of the people at the center of the talk, having left Vermont at gunpoint because of his labor organizing activities. His current tendency to talk up unions is unsettling to his wife and unacceptable to his employer. He could lose his job at the whim of the manager and their home along with it.Sylvie and her older brother attend school. Their toddler brother is home with their mother. Sylvie is a talented student. She wins an essay contest with the local newspaper selecting a daring topic., The Moonstone City Record's female editor is college educated, fiercely independent and progressive. Obviously, she, too is unacceptable to the Padgetts as she increasingly writes critical articles about their employment practices and mine safety.  Miss Redmond hires Sylvie to work for her setting type. Eventually she lets Sylvie report on family news and accidents at the mine.Because she is bilingual in French and English, Sylvie is invited to apply for a position with the mine owners' wife as a secretary for the summer. ""Duke"" Padgett is obscenely wealthy, with holdings far beyond this mine.. He's from Richmond Virginia and his wife (the ""Countess"") is from Belgium, where they met in King Leopold's Court. They summer near Moonstone, living  in the lavish home they built, Elkhorn Mansion, entertaining visitors from all over.  Guests are treated to balls dinners including oysters from the East and other costly delicacies.  Duke's son Jasper, attends Harvard but he is also in Moonstone for the summer. Two of Duke's former slaves, John and Easter Grady work there as cook and driver. The Grady's son Caleb is there for the summer and serves as a chef on the Padgetts' private railroad car. Their other son, Marcus, is in a different part of Colorado where he hopes to participate in building a town for ""Negroes."" Jasper is very close to the Gradys, as Easter took care of him when his mother died.Sylvie experiences the harsh reality of her father's work and the risks he takes when he encourages his fellow workers to consider fairer treatment. She sees what her mother must do in their meager surroundings to care for her family and help provide for them. She witnesses a variety of immigrant families' adjustment to the harsh conditions of Colorado Mountain winters with no pay because the mine is shut down for the season. She is subjected to harsh comments about the newspaper and her role there. She's spent eight weeks with a front row seat to people living at a level of luxury she could not have imagined. During that time, she connected personally with the Countess, who made something of a pet of her. She connected personally with Jasper almost as a friend. Later, Sylvie meets Mother Jones and the organizer sent by the national union. She's there, when they speak to her father and his coworkers and she's there for the backlash. Pinkerton men arrive, vicious and heartless. She witnesses the challenges faced by the Gradys in seeking how to make their way independently. Ultimately, all of these people interact with Sylvie in life-changing ways that make for an amazing story of the people of turn of the century Colorado.So,  this is the story of one smart, attractive and courageous girl's life.  We learn how a variety of opportunities, challenges and a range of people from different classes, countries and backgrounds shape who she is. She takes risks.  She makes choices that a situationally moral but would put her in jail if she were discovered. She sometimes follows her heart and loses her way. The characters are fabulous, the story fascinating and fun, dark and sad, exciting, quiet and surprising.

4.0,Atmospheric Historical Fiction and Present-Day Parallels:  Women Betrayed,"3.5.  Eliza is 12 in 1791 London.  She is in service to Mrs. Amwell, who dispatches Eliza on an errand to a hidden shop -- an apothecary-- where Nella, aging and sick, compounds death for men who betray women.  Caroline flew alone to  London for what was supposed to be her tenth-anniversary trip.  She's left James her unfaithful accountant husband behind.  On a whim, Caroline goes joins a  mudlarking group in the Thames looking for items in the riverbed.  She finds an old blue vial, intact, with a small bear etched on it.  Before her marriage, Caroline planned to pursue an advanced history degree. The vial awakens the history bug in her.  The Lost Apothecary alternates among Eliza's, Nella's, and Caroline's first-person narratives.  I particularly enjoyed the historic chapters and the characters, Nella, Eliza, and the women they serve. Some things made no sense.  For example, Nella repeatedly and unconvincingly explains why she maintained and failed to destroy a registry that would implicate every woman who used her services.  Sometimes, ""over"" explaining draws attention to a less believable but necessary plotline.  I recommend a lighter touch.  As to the present-day chapters, I did not connect emotionally to Caroline. The concept for the modern chapters works. The storyline is fine.  The pieces showing how Caroline conducts research and finds answers hang together. I don't actively dislike Caroline. But I really didn't care what happens to her,  Like the historical chapters, the present-day chapters have some ""huh?"" moments. Here and there, Penner again draws attention to the least believable parts of the plot by overexplaining.  Most mysteries include little facts and plot twists that barely make sense.  If they leave such gaping holes that you keep explaining them to the reader, find a way to change the story  If they are necessary but somewhat unbelievable or problematic, go lightly on the explanation.  I  like the themes Penner examines as to what options exist for women harmed by men, then and now. The women in various classes and stages of life are connected by thoughts of becoming a woman (menstruation), whether or not to have children, loss of children, inability to have children, and how this shapes their lives. I enjoyed reading about medicine in the late eighteenth century and the apothecaries' role in treating the rich and middling classes.  Despite my quibbles about over-explaining, Penner's style is enjoyable:  I would read this book again and recommend it to certain friends.  I  absolutely will look for and buy Penner's future novels of this type.",2021-05-29 17:56:29.594,0.0,False,Kindle_Store,en,negative,0.564358115196228,0.5237131714820862,['hidden shop'],5.0

I honestly did not like the fact that I need to actually 'make' the product before I use it. When in the shower, I found the powder difficult to manage and I don't feel the exfoliating action works as well as some others I still use.

I had never used one of gaiter face masks before (I had more traditional paper or cloth wrap around the ears ones).

These are easy to put on, they do fit snugly (which may or may not be a comfort issue for you). They are not very comfortable in a hot environment because these are not cotton based (I live in Florida and they are hot when being worn outside). However, when shopping, these are great.

1.0,Was nice while it lasted,"I absolutely love this Friedrich. To be honest, I had a Fellowes unit in my bedroom that I used to find annoyingly loud at times, but I kept it going just so the air in my room would be clean. When I turned on this Friedrich, I could see the difference between the two units was amazing. First, it is quieter. One must keep in mind, however, that there is always some noise to these units. I actually like the hum of the Friedrich as it blocks out noises and allows me to sleep better (with it's low fan). I love to watch the unit go through it's cleansing cycles. I had fried some foods one night earlier this week and forgot about it until I went into bed. I noticed at that that lights on the Friedrich were now red (indicating 'dirty' air), which must have been caused by the frying on the other side of my house. When I woke up in the morning, all the lights were blue again and I didn't detect any smell of the night before's cooking! I can also feel my allergies (which have been bad in South Florida this winter) are relieved immensely. I love this Friedrich and recommend it to anyone looking to breath better and healthier!Update from June 2014: About two weeks ago I started to hear 5 beeps every 30-60 minutes coming from this purifier. Thinking it might be the filter, I changed out the entire set up (at a cost of $45). Plugged it back in and the beeping started up again and I moved it into my spare bedroom (where I wouldn;t be annoyed). Within a week, the unit shut down and just had the power light flashing and the beeping now is non-stop. I couldn't find the owner's manual, so I searched tirelessly on line to see if Friederich had an online manual. No, they don't (at least not for the AP260).

5.0,Riveting - Couldn't Put It Down,"I never have had any interest in horses or horseracing.  Still don't.  In spite of that I found this book so enjoyable that I couldn't put it down and read it very rapidly.  I saw the movie first, so maybe that helped?  Even if you didn't like the movie (I did), I do recommend you give the book a try.  It is (of course) much more detailed.  Some reviewers found it too detailed, but I thought the initimate details of the lives of the parties involved made this much more enjoyable than if it had been just a book about horseracing.  Some say the first section of the book is slow.  Perhaps so, but I found it interesting and enjoyable and a nice foundation to finally introducing the horse. Includes a fascinating look at the hard life of jockey's in the 30's & 40's.  Worth reading just for that.  Inspiring, emotional, heartwarming story that will have you in tears at times.  Hildebrand knows how to grab the reader and never let go.  Yes, it may be a little syrupy, preachy and overdone at times, but always enjoyable and never boring.  Not many writers could appeal to such a wide audience in a book that is supposedly about horseracing.  It is so much more than a ""horse"" book.  It is really about a team of unlikely people and animals who on their own were failures and worth very little, but as a team came together to produce one of the most enduring legends in American history.",2006-06-13 19:42:43.000,2.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.9315542578697205,0.9326721429824829,[],5.0

5.0,Brings vegetables and whole grains back into the spotlight where they belong!,"Like many Greeks, Aglaia Kremezi grew up eating mostly vegetarian food: foraged greens, garden vegetables, beans of all kinds, fruity olive oil, and local cheeses and yogurt. Until recently, this was a typical Greek diet; meat was traditionally a rare and expensive commodity reserved for Sundays and holidays (daily meat consumption is still a relatively new phenomenon in Greece) and thus Greeks were mainly vegetarians out of necessity.Kremezi owns a cooking school in Greece called Kea Artisanal, and is the author of the popular “The Foods of Greece” and “Mediterranean Hot and Spicy.” Her newest cookbook “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” contains 150 simple, yet abundantly flavorful, plant-based seasonal dishes from Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, France, and Italy. Sample seasonal menu suggestions offer a wide range of options, including several buffet spreads and one-pot family meals. Recipes are conveniently labeled as vegan and/or gluten-free when applicable, and ingredients are given in American and metric measurements. There is a comprehensive list of online and mail order sources to ensure that you have the necessary ingredients on hand. In the spirit of Mediterranean cuisine, “use only what is freshest and in season;” Kremezi suggests that you “go to your local farmers’ market without a recipe or shopping list in hand, choose the seasonal produce that inspires you, and only then search the pages that follow for a recipe that will showcase your fresh ingredients.”The book begins with a chapter on basic preparations and techniques. Here you will find an arsenal of herbs, seasonings, pickles and preserves that will allow you to quickly transform a dish. You’ll also find an excellent guide to preparing and storing various types of leafy greens. Meze are the star of the show, including dips and spreads, salads, and baked and fried vegetables. If you are planning an all-meze meal (my favorite kind!), start with spreads, pickles, and cold vegetable dishes, then finish with the warm plates. Kremezi suggests serving meze with ouzo or white or rosé wines.In addition to Greek dishes, you’re just as likely to come across a Tunisian dish as a Balkan, Sicilian or Turkish one. Some of my favorite discoveries were the quince stuffed with wheat berries, nuts, and raisins, zucchini rolls stuffed with halloumi, and flatbread with dried figs, Roquefort cheese, and rosemary. The section on breads is excellent, including a homemade version of tortas de aceite as well as a pumpkin, tangerine, and marmalade bread. Desserts include a custardy orange and crumbled phyllo cake, rustic chocolates with dried figs, pistachios and toasted nuts and a quince spoon sweet (I loved the spicy variation infused with ginger, allspice and cayenne).Along the way, Kremezi imparts many fascinating stories into the origins of ingredients and techniques common to Mediterranean cuisines, and the stunning photography by Penny De Los Santos captures fresh produce, ingredients and dishes in a series of vibrant still lifes. The diverse Mediterranean vegetarian (and vegan) dishes featured within are sure to delight even the pickiest eater or devout carnivore. Sadly, all too often vegetarian main courses seem like an afterthought, but the recipes showcased in “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” are certain to become instant classics and bring vegetables and whole grains back into the spotlight where they belong.Whether you are already vegetarian or are simply interested in the Mediterranean diet and eating more healthfully, “Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts” deserves a place of honor in your cookbook collection.(This review was originally published for Mediterranean Living)",2015-01-16 23:22:46.000,21.0,False,Books,en,negative,0.8226202726364136,0.9808995723724365,"['disappointment', 'expecting']",1.0

In the third novel, Hourglass, the mysteries of Bianca's birth (two vampires can only have a child with the help of wraiths, or ghosts) are slowly and painfully unraveled as she and Lucas live life on the lam.At the close of ""Stargazer,"" Evernight Academy was torched by the Black Cross, a powerful vampire hunting society that's existed for over a millennium. Now, Bianca and Lucas must take refuge in the place that endangers Bianca the most...right in the heart of the enemy. As Bianca fights to escape detection as a vampire, she begins to experience worsening dizzy spells. Cut off from her parents and her friends at Evernight, most notably Balthazar, Bianca is uncertain what to expect from her changing body. No one ever told her what happens to a half-vampire who refuses to make the transition...""Hourglass"" contains a winning blend of action and romance. Bianca's world is turned upside-down; former Evernight friends become enemies, and certain former enemies lend a hand. Bianca's relationship with Lucas finally heats up (tastefully).

5.0,"Simple recipes for a long life, the Shoku-Iku way!","Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori, Shoku Iku (“food education”) is a Japanese concept involving conscious eating: what we eat, how we prepare it, and how different foods are combined. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori, shoku iku is based on the power of five: each meal should have five colors (green/blue, red/orange, white, black/brown, yellow), tastes (sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami), senses, food groups and cooking methods (steam, simmer, broil, grill and fry, no-cook, sushi).Makiko Sano’s new book “Healthy Japanese Cooking” (published in the UK as “Shoku Iku”) immediately caught my eye; having lived in Japan on multiple occasions, I have long been attracted to Japanese washoku (traditional cuisine) and shojin ryori (Buddhist vegan cuisine). Traditional Japanese meals are based on the freshest seasonal ingredients, engage all the senses, and if eaten properly and with mindfulness, should leave you satisfied but not stuffed (the Japanese concept of hara hachi bu, or eat until you are 80 percent full).Beginning with the essential dashi (stock) and dressings (rosemary soy, sweet soy, sesame salad sprinkle, shabu shabu and others), there are very handy illustrations and step-by-step photos to instruct you on rolling sushi, julienning vegetables, etc. Dashi is the backbone of most Japanese soups / hot pots, and you'll find several variations here, including basic dashi (kelp + bonito flakes), vegetarian dashi (kelp and dried shiitake), Motoko's dashi (made with liquid from cooking brown rice; I had not seen this method in my other cookbooks!), and two soup stocks.I found the chapter on steaming particularly helpful as I have not cooked fish via this method before, but you’ll find heavenly steamed sea bream, a posh cod dinner in 20 minutes, steamed chicken, stuffed veggies, pork dumplings, etc., most cooked in the microwave. However, a word of caution; these recipes were tested at 800 watts, and it would appear that American microwaves are more powerful in general (mine is 1.58 kW), so you may need to adjust cooking times.Some of the steamed dishes are cooked on the stovetop; my new favorite discovery is the “Full Japanese” garden breakfast, full of leafy greens, tomatoes, mushrooms and eggs nestled into the greens. I also loved the vegan monk recipe for stuffed pumpkin and steamed sticky rice, which is full of carrots, shiitake, and mushrooms (you can leave out the chicken to make it vegan). And my favorite steamed custard chawanmushi also makes an appearance, as do perfect teatime snacks mochi, sweet potato treats, and fruit buns.The fried chapter includes Japanese burgers and shrimp barbecue, but you’ll also find healthy low-fat vegetarian options like Japanese grilled vegetable “stir fry” (half grilled, half steamed), eggplant and shallot salad, “full of goodness” (with a liberal helping of my favorite Japanese vegetable, lotus root!), and chili tofu. The sushi chapter features an amazing brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi, temaki, sesame seed salmon sushi, brown rice tuna sushi with sweet-hot sauce, five senses super-tasty salmon sushi, and some new variations like wasabi cream cheese sushi with lamb, avocado and pear quinoa power sushi, and sushi canapes.Ingredients are listed both in metric and US (volume). Beautiful full-color photos by Lisa Linder capture the aesthetic of Japanese cuisine, with beautiful tableware that offsets the featured dish perfectly.The resulting dishes, all of which embrace the “shoku iku” philosophy, are light, nutritious, and provide plenty of variety of colors, flavors, and textures that are sure to brighten any meal. I found several new dishes that I plan on making frequently, including the egg and tofu dashi soup, rice noodles with mushroom broth, pan tai, iced tomatoes, brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi, and steamed sticky rice.If you are new to Japanese cooking / flavors, then “Healthy Japanese Cooking” is the perfect introduction as it uses commonplace ingredients (you may have to order some of the more traditional ingredients like kombu and bonito flakes online), simple techniques, and is aligned much more closely with the traditional Japanese diet based on fish and vegetables than many Japanese cookbooks aimed at Western audiences.(Thank you to Makiko Sano for the review copy!)",2015-11-14 22:49:44.000,22.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.7572909593582153,0.9624824523925781,"['elementary student', 'nice quick']",5.0

5.0,A must-have reference for serious home bakers / aspiring pastry chefs,"The Professional Pastry Chef by Bo Friberg is a must-have reference for all serious bakers / pastry chefs. It appears frequently as part of baking / pastry arts curriculums for good reason: Chef Bo clearly explains techniques and plating suggestions with a healthy (and entertaining) dash of food science along the way. The first of two volumes (the second being [[ASIN:0471359262 The Advanced Professional Pastry Chef]]), this gorgeous (and hefty) tome walks the novice pastry chef through glazes, meringues, basic doughs (short dough, puff pastry, pate a choux, pasta), yeast breads, breakfast breads and pastries, quick breads / pound cakes, sponge cakes, decorated cakes, individual pastries, ice cream, and custard-type desserts. The section on plated desserts is worth the price of the book alone, as you'll find templates for pastry cutouts, piping instructions, etc.First and foremost, this is NOT a book for the average home baker. In most cases, the yields (and quantities, which are given in weights, not volume) are geared towards restaurants  / foodservice, although certain bread recipes are scaled down for smaller yields, such as the small-batch Black Forest bread with cocoa and dried cherries, challah, and Southwestern corn and cheese bread.The included line drawings are enormously helpful to illustrate techniques. The Chef's Tips and sidebars further explain techniques or recipe-specific advice. Several in-depth charts like cookie recipes categorized by texture, production method, and storage capability provide an at-a-glance guide to what would be an otherwise overwhelming number of recipes to juggle.The book particularly excels in its treatment of European (French/Italian/Viennese) pastries. Even the ice cream chapter yields unique flavor surprises, like the macadamia nut ice cream, banana-poppy seed ice cream, and avocado-mango ice cream. You'll find unusual frozen yogurts as well, like black-pepper honey, gingered pineapple, and strawberry-rhubarb frozen yogurt with ginger, that provide a welcome change.The comprehensive appendices cover nearly 150 pages alone, including an extremely thorough glossary of ingredients and tools, precise metric conversions and metric equivalents, metric/US length, weight, and volume equivalents,  and a particularly helpful section on yields, baker's percentages, and Baumé / Brix scale readings.Despite owning several dozen baking books, I find myself coming back time and again to ""The Professional Pastry Chef"" for its clear instructions, charts, and fascinating food science tidbits. Chef Bo makes for a most pleasant and patient instructor, and his thorough explanations of techniques and ingredients will serve you well whether you're an advanced home baker or an experienced pastry chef.(Many thanks to Wiley for the review copy)",2012-10-27 21:18:44.000,2.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.4528757333755493,0.9802733659744263,[],5.0

4.0,"Delicious Mediterranean meze and baked goods, but needs some minor edits","Several years ago, a fellow cookbook collector gifted me a copy of Ana Sortun's excellent [[ASIN:0060792280 Spice: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean]], and I fell instantly and madly in love. Sortun is the executive chef behind Oleana and Sofra. Classically trained at La Varenne, she decided to incorporate Mediterranean spices and the mezze mentality after studying in Turkey. Sofra Cafe and Bakery opened in 2008 and serves mezze and baked goods from Turkey, Lebanon, and Greece, all of which are amply represented in &quot;Soframiz.&quot;I've long admired Turkish cuisine and have collected numerous books on the subject (including recent releases [[ASIN:1743368577 Istanbul Cult Recipes]], [[ASIN:1849496633 Eat Istanbul: A Journey to the Heart of Turkish Cuisine]], and [[ASIN:1743360495 Anatolia: Adventures in Turkish Cooking]]), so when I heard that Ana and Maura Kilpatrick were coming out with a Sofra cookbook, I was ecstatic. I've had the galley for several months, and have made numerous recipes from the book, including the spicy tomato bulgur salad, stuffed simit, Persian carrot and black eyed pea salad, and tahini shortbread cookies.The recipes include breakfast, meze, flatbreads, savory pies, cookies and confections, specialty pastries, cakes and desserts, and beverages. If you've never experienced a Turkish (or Israeli) breakfast, you're in for a treat; traditional breakfast spreads include many small bowls and plates of olives, tahini, stuffed flatbreads, egg dishes, vegetables and cheeses taking up the entire table. Breakfast at Sofra includes such staples as Shakshuka (baked eggs with spicy tomato sauce), rolled omelet with za'atar and labne, flower pogaca rolls, date orange brioche tart, pistachio toaster pastries with rosewater glaze, and morning buns iwth orange blossom glaze.The meze really shine and make for inspired snacking or afternoon pick-me-ups, from the whipped cheese spreads and hummus to hearty and healthy bean-based salads (Persian carrot and black-eyed peas, Egyptian-style pea salad with walnuts, barley and chickpea salad, yellow split peas with za'atar spiced almonds). I made several for this review and all were definite repeats.My true passion is baking, so the breads and baked goods were the real test. My first disappointment was that measurements are only given in volume, not weight; as a serious home baker, I much prefer the precision of weighing my flours, particularly as I live in an extremely humid climate (which affects the weight of flour). I also had some issues with several of the bread recipes I tried; the stuffed simit featured on the cover calls for 1 cup water to 2 1/4 cups of flour, and what initially greeted me was almost like pancake batter. I continued to add flour by the tablespoon, as well as a little olive oil, and eventually had a very soft (but workable) dough that was wonderfully moist. The Turkish method of brushing with pekmez (grape molasses) lends a sweet finish to the savory filling of feta and za'atar spiced almonds and the toasted sesame seed topping. The bread is delicious on its own or as an accompaniment to the salads in the book.Fans of Middle Eastern pastries will be in heaven; from pistachio bird's nests (a recipe I have not encountered in my many other Turkish books) to Persian love cake, kunefe, umm Ali with caramelized apples, chocolate hazelnut baklava, brown butter pecan pie with espresso dates, date espresso ma'amoul, and milky walnut-fig baklava, this is a baker's paradise.I encountered an issue with the tahini shortbread cookies, which calls for 2 tsp salt; I cross-checked the recipe on the internet, and the online version I found also called for 2 tsp. salt. My baker's instinct told me to start with much less; I went with 1/2 tsp salt, which is what most of the other cookie and shortbread recipes in &quot;Soframiz&quot; called for, and I'm certainly glad I didn't use the full amount as they would have been too salty for my taste. Also, I followed the recipe to the letter, and ended up with more like 3 or 4 dozen cookies. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup toasted sesame seeds but you are only instructed to use 1/4 cup. The resulting cookies were absolutely delicious and would be fantastic as part of a cheese tray as the sesame lends a savory edge.Gorgeous matte photography and clear, large font make this a pleasure to read and cook from (I prefer matte pages as it means no glare in my cookbook holder). I loved the recipes I tried, but found in several instances that there are small errors, so be sure to read through the entire recipe in advance and make note if an ingredient is mentioned that is not in the list, or an amount seems off.Overall &quot;Soframiz&quot; is one of my top cookbook picks for 2016 (I'll be releasing my 2016 cookbook roundup in the next month or two), and one that fans of Turkish, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine will certainly want to add to their collections.",2016-10-22 09:42:12.000,97.0,True,Books,en,neutral,0.4298570454120636,0.5507236123085022,[],5.0
5.0,A Book That Stirs Memories...,"Occasionally I finish a book that leaves me not wanting begin another, at least for a little while, because it really stays with me .I did not want to ruin the stirring feelings I had upon completing Nine, Ten. (This is out of the ordinary for me, as I normally start on another book the minute I finish one.)  It took me back to Before...My boys were four and two...and I remembered how different America was when they were small; on September 10th...before.  Nine, Ten reminded me of what it's like to read historical fiction, good historical fiction, about the Titanic. When an author does as wonderful a job writing about a major event as Baskin does, you do not want to stop reading, even though you know what's coming. Even the author notes and  the acknowledgements  were heart- rending.  I have already recommended Nine, Ten to several people. I think this book would be a wonderful way to teach others about 9-11.It will probably be a nostalgia trip for parents of today, most of whom will remember Before...and how it was so different.",2016-08-01 01:54:00.000,4.0,False,Books,en,neutral,0.5442545413970947,0.6213802099227905,"['believable', 'book', 'years ago']",2.0

5.0,Make great yeast bread in a snap!,"I've been baking just about every *other* kind of baked good for the last two years (quick bread, cake, pie, brownies, cookies), but avoided yeast breads like the plague since my several prior attempts turned out like bricks, particularly when using refrigerated dough. Enter ""Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day;"" using the master dough recipe (and its variations), you can whip together nearly endless combinations of sweet and savory yeast doughs including brioche, challah, buttermilk, oatmeal, rye, and several ethnic breads (limpa, ciabatta, baguette, pumpernickel) in a few minutes with the stir of a spoon: no kneading required.Sounds too easy to be true? I tried making the master dough recipe and several variants (brioche and challah-based enriched pastries including chocolate brioche, caramel pecan rolls and almond bostock), and all turned out beautifully. Remember: my first breads turned out like bricks, so having fluffy, flavorful loaves on my first try was nothing short of a miracle. I combined several tips from ""Artisan Bread"" with some of Carole Walter's advice from [[ASIN:0307237559 Great Coffee Cakes, Sticky Buns, Muffins & More: 200 Anytime Treats and Special Sweets for Morning to Midnight]]: use lukewarm, 100-degree water (too hot and you'll kill the yeast), and let dough rise in a slightly warm oven at about 100 degrees), and this seemed to fix my prior problems.The book includes crusty peasant loaves baked on pizza stones (to achieve maximum crunch, mist the crust with water when you slide the dough in) as well as egg-and-butter enriched challah and brioche that serve as vehicles to sweet endings such as bostock (almond-and-orange-scented sweet rolls), sticky pecan rolls, chocolate brioche, panettone, and babka. There are also some non-bread recipes included that make the perfect pairing with the book's included breads, such as Door County cherry preserves, salads, granola, Tuscan bean dip, gazpacho, and Portuguese fish stew.The book's website includes several updates on errors in the book, so be sure to check first if you're in doubt about the amount of a certain ingredient. If you're a home baker tired of paying artisan bakery prices, but long for truly great bread at home, this is an easy, gentle introduction to yeast breads that require minimal effort (doughwise; rolling and filling is still messy!!) and it makes a wonderful gift.",2009-01-01 00:56:11.000,8.0,False,Books,en,negative,0.43817755579948425,0.9372035264968872,['find'],5.0

5.0,A vegetarian taste of Morocco that's sure to delight!,"Ghillie Basan, author of several cookbooks on Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine including [[ASIN:1848859848 Classic Turkish Cooking]] and [[ASIN:1845979486 Tagines & Couscous: Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One-pot Cooking]], offers up a vegetarian (mostly vegan) Moroccan feast in ""Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous.""  Although at first glance this would appear to be a slim volume (65 recipes total), ""Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous"" is a wonderful all-in-one source for Moroccan pantry staples, light mezze and appetizers, creative ways to make the most of seasonal vegetables and produce, and wonderful couscous and fruit salads that are welcome any time of year. The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out, and most ingredients should be readily available at your local supermarket. Most of the recipes can be easily made vegan by swapping out agave for honey, using olive oil in place of butter, or by omitting the cheese and eggs (there are relatively few recipes that call for either).Beginning with essential recipes such as preserved lemons, smen, harissa, chermoula, and ras el hanout, the book offers a diverse selection of light appetizers including cracked green olives and cardamom and harissa, crudités with red chilli dukkah dip, filo fingers stuffed with feta, olives, and preserved lemon, smoked aubergine and yogurt dip with harissa, and strained yogurt and cucumber dip with rose petals. There are also several flavor-infused soups like creamy pumpkin soup with ginger and chilli honey and chilled almond and garlic soup.The included tagines (both light and hearty) offer a wide range of preparations of vegetables and legumes including the wonderful tagine of artichokes, broad beans, apricots and almonds, onion, olive, and egg tagine with zahtar, and tagine of spicy roasted pumpkin wedges with lime. There are also a number of fruit tagines including the tagine of roasted pear with figs, walnuts and cardamom, stuffed prune tagine with walnuts and rosewater, and pumpkin, apple, and sultana tagine with chermoula, that are a wonderful way to braise fruit to a soft, creamy consistency. I enjoyed the stuffed prune tagine with its spiced wine reduction over Greek yogurt in the mornings!The cooking instructions for the several couscous dishes yield a light, fluffy couscous unlike the ""typical"" American boxed couscous. True Moroccan couscous is made fresh and is slowly steamed and fluffed until light and airy. The couscous recipes here are a compromise between the two methods, yielding light, fluffy couscous without the long time steaming, fluffing, adding liquid and repeating. Ghillie has you first soak the couscous in warm water, then fluff the grains with a fork to separate, rub oil into the grains using your fingers, then aerate before baking to heat through. I attempted the couscous with dried fruit and nuts and it turned out every bit as beautiful (and delicious) as the cover photo! You'll also find the traditional couscous with seven vegetables as well as a saffron couscous with roasted coconut and pistachios, couscous with hot apricot chutney and halloumi (the recipe for the homemade chutney is worth the cost of the book alone!), and harissa couscous with pine nuts and fried eggs.One important word of caution is that your type of tagine and stovetop may result in many of these being prepared in a dish other than a tagine as many of the tagines are cooked on the stovetop versus oven; I have a ceramic stovetop and two clay tagines and was advised not to use clay/terra cotta tagines even with a heat diffuser, so for the many stovetop preparations I used my 4.5-quart Staub Dutch oven instead. If you have a Staub or Le Creuset cast iron tagine, then you should be fine using them directly on a ceramic stovetop.One of my favorite parts (and a wonderful way to close out a meal) is the gorgeous fruit salads; I made the orange and date salad with chillies and preserved lemon and grapefruit and pomegranate salad with rosewater (see photo); these quickly became favorites and I make them at least every other week now. They are easy to put together and the flavors work wonderfully together, not to mention the striking presentation (I like to fan out the orange segments into a star shape). The contrast between sweet and tart (the preserved lemons), or fruity and floral, serves to balance out spicier dishes or as an anytime treat. Several basic jams and pickle recipes are also included (tomato jam with cinnamon and roasted sesame seeds, lemon, coriander and mint jam, pickled pears with saffron and cinnamon, date relish, and pickled red chillies and purple turnips).The book's graphic layout and photography by Steve Painter is also stunning, featuring vibrant piles of spices, silks, and gorgeous tilework interspersed throughout. There are full-page, full-color photos for nearly every finished dish.I find myself turning to ""Vegetarian Tagines & Couscous"" frequently for the many creative, delicious takes on traditional Moroccan stews; there is plenty of variety to keep you experimenting happily for many weeks or months to come!(review copy courtesy of Ryland Peters & Small)",2014-03-03 22:49:05.000,30.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.9420017004013062,0.7523972392082214,[],5.0

5.0,A beautiful mixture of cultures and memories,"Tessa Kiros, daughter of a Finnish mother and a Greek Cypriot father, recounts the various flavors of her childhood and adult life (Finland, Greece, South Africa, Italy and beyond). Stories are interwoven into the simple yet delicious recipes and sprinkled with vintage family photographs and luminous photos that highlight the character of the faces and places that make these recipes memorable.Falling Cloudberries opens with a pencil sketch of Tessa's family tree, complete with a Russian great-great-grandmother, her mother's Finnish relatives, and Tessa's Italian husband. The first chapter is dedicated to Finnish comfort foods such as marinated herrings, smoked salmon, Finnish meatballs with lingonberry jam, and cinnamon and cardamom buns. From Greece we have dolmades, baklava, tzatziki, avgolemono, octopus, and numerous lamb and seafood dishes. Cyprus is the most Middle Eastern of the cuisines, featuring airani (a chilled yogurt drink), grilled haloumi, hummus, lachmajou, tabouli, and koupes.The chapter on South Africa is a mix of culinary influences that feels right at home in the United States: garlic bread, chicken wings with blue cheese dressing, barbecue, and carrot cake. Italy offers a divine champagne risotto, several pastas, and numerous elegant salads. The final chapter, A Suitcase of Recipes, features influences from farther abroad, including Thailand, Peru, and Morocco.Tessa's style, both in the memoirs and the recipes themselves, is simple yet elegant. The ingredients and steps are clearly laid out, making Falling Cloudberries approachable even for beginning cooks. Most of the Greek and Italian ingredients should be fairly easy to find in any large supermarket (if you're lucky enough to have a Middle Eastern market in your city, you should be able to find rose water, haloumi and semolina (NOT semolina flour, but sameed, the cracked wheat used in basboosah).There's a beautiful amount of variety in the endless possibility of mix-and-match dinners borrowing from different regions, or you could plan a theme party (a Finnish dinner, or a Greek one). Vegetarians will find numerous tasty recipes for cold salads (such as the chickpea and feta salad), baked dishes, as well as numerous potato preparations (the stuffed vegetables call for ground meat, but you could substitute rice). I loved the light, elegant desserts in particular, from flaky filo recipes for baklava and bougatsa to elegant shortcakes, chocolate truffle cake and creme caramel.

5.0,Healthy eating in a hurry - perfect for busy weeknights!,"I own and have reviewed several (unofficial) Trader Joe’s cookbooks and cook from all of them regularly, so was excited to see “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s Cookbook.” It’s no secret that one of my favorite stores on the planet is Trader Joe’s. I first discovered them while still living in Michigan, and it would be an eight-year wait before my city in Texas got their first store (in the meantime, I would smuggle home suitcases full of TJ’s manna-like cookie butter and dried fruit). Although I currently live 8,000 miles away from the nearest store (and will for the next several years), I have a hefty supply of shelf-stable TJ’s products that friends and family are kind enough to send in care packages.So I was excited to see the new release “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s Cookbook: Over 75 Easy, Delicious Recipes for Every Meal.” A freelance illustrator, author Bonnie Matthews was hit hard by the economic downturn in 2008  and also saw the end to a seven-year relationship. She had gotten up to nearly 300 pounds before deciding that she needed to change; she started cooking healthier meals using Trader Joe’s products and eventually lost 130 pounds through a combination of healthier eating and working out. Her employee discount at Trader Joe’s meant that she had the chance to create delicious recipes that would let her stick to her newfound healthy lifestyle: “I had to make peace with food and make better choices or I knew that I would not be able to survive.” Dr. Oz dubbed Bonnie a “Wellness Warrior” on his show and gave Bonnie a blog on DoctorOz.com; this launched her journey as a cookbook author.Something that my loyal readers may not be aware of is that I lost and have kept off around 35 pounds for the last 15 years. Starting in junior high and high school, I began to pack on the pounds onto my 5’1” frame through a combination of junk food, soda, candy, and lack of exercise. In high school I weighed about 125; by the time I earned my BA from Western Michigan in 2003, that number had ballooned to over 140 and I barely fit into a size 12. I had finally had enough and changed my habits (and diet) drastically; I started to exercise every day, cut out regular sodas, stopped eating fast food, switched to whole grains, fresh vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and gradually adopted a vegetarian (now pescetarian) diet. In a matter of months, I’d dropped over 30 pounds. Some of that weight had crept back over the last 10 years in Texas (in large part because of the extreme heat, lack of sidewalks, and places to exercise outside), but last year I finally got back down to my grad school weight that I hadn’t seen since 2006.The gorgeous photography (which Bonnie also shot) and easy-to-read font make this easy to cook from; number of servings can be found on the upper-left-hand side, with a full-color photo for each recipe appearing to the right. There are lots of international influences to keep dinner interesting, from Moroccan-inspired tagines to Greek chicken with eggplant and onion, Thai red curry with roasted kabocha squash and shrimp, pork tenderloin medallions with rosemary marinade, and pasta dishes. Each recipe comes with a brief introduction from Bonnie with additional tips, tricks, and info about specific ingredients. Although the recipes rely on shortcuts (TJ’s frozen veggies, sauces, etc), there are minimal highly-processed ingredients. Because of this, prep times are very reasonable, with many of the main dishes on the table in 30 minutes or less.Whether you’re looking to make a healthier lifestyle change or are simply looking for new ideas for delicious, healthy weeknight meals, “The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joe’s” truly has something for everyone!",2016-08-15 21:00:43.000,17.0,False,Books,en,negative,0.5837278962135315,0.9374653697013855,['interesting'],5.0

3.0,Needs a lot of supplements as-is; online learning center not worth the extra cost,"I took my first GRE in 2003 after completing my BA. I'm considering applying to a PhD program, and all the schools I looked at require a GRE score from the last five years or so, so I needed to go back to square one. I'm extremely weak in math skills (this was my weak point on my first GRE), and I was hoping that the Kaplan GRE Exam Premier with CD-ROM would help me review basic concepts.The first thing I did was to register the online companion (the code is printed inside the back cover). This unlocks a three-month trial (despite the fact that the enrollment agreement says that you'll continue to have access for six months), which includes printable study sheets, GRE software for your PDA (Kaplan To Go!, which costs an additional $24.95), a few practice tests, and some short videos. Many of the ""suggested readings"" aren't even online, but are in the book (it would have been helpful to have these come up when you click on them). This seems a bit deceptive, as the book's cover says ""more practice questions available online every month!"" True, but only if you continue to pay for online access. However, many of the links didn't work, and those that did linked directly to Kaplan's GRE prep courses, which come at a hefty fee.  The included CD-ROM is Windows only, and you have to have it in the drive every time you use it.Now, the whole reason I wanted a GRE review book was for the quantitative section. And it's sorely lacking; the math concept review section at the end of the book is about 20 pages long. Also, other reviewers have pointed out the numerous mistakes (apparently Kaplan uses actual test questions, but has rewritten them in such a way that they're sometimes missing critical information). Kaplan groups GRE math into three levels: Level 1 (basic), Level 2 (skills and formulas), and Level 3. I'm completely deficient in Level 1, and was looking for a review of fractions, plotting points, etc. The book does not address this. It does include reviews of geometry, but I needed the basics. There are some helpful strategies on time management during the quantitative part of the test.The descriptions of the AWA (Analytical Writing Assessment) are somewhat better, discussing the scoring system in detail, with numerous examples. There's also a list of word roots that may be helpful for some.There is only one full-length test included in the book, with access to six additional verbals and six quantitative tests on the CD-ROM, and access to a few more full-length tests online during your free trial. Another issue with this system is that the practice tests online are paced at one a month, meaning that you only get three additional tests before your free trial is over (the first time I logged in, it showed several tests, but now I only have one).Kaplan's main objective is making money; it's why they publish so many add-ons like [[ASIN:141955221X Kaplan GRE Exam Math Workbook]], [[ASIN:1607140527 Kaplan GRE Exam Vocabulary in a Box]], and [[ASIN:1419552198 Kaplan GRE Exam Verbal Workbook (Kaplan Gre Verbal Workbook)]] and push their online classes so heavily. I wouldn't mind that attitude if the material in the book was helpful, but unfortunately I found myself confused by some of their walkthroughs of math problems, and had to keep looking up math points online as I was working through the practice problems. This might be a good choice if you're fairly comfortable with vocabulary and basic / intermediate math, but if you need more in-depth review, you might be better off looking elsewhere or combining several resources.",2010-05-30 17:54:16.000,6.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.7706674933433533,0.5005632042884827,['customs'],5.0

5.0,A nice update on a classic,"I have loved and used my original edition of ""Artisan Bread in Five"" and gifted several friends with copies - it truly changed my baking habits and has allowed me to put away my bread machine and make homemade bread and rolls (even pastries) at least once a week. Predictably, I was overjoyed when I was offered the chance to review the New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes A Day, featuring many more photos, new recipes (including a whole chapter on gluten-free dough), and updated information.You'll now find revised proofing times, updated equipment guides (I recently purchased a [[ASIN:B00DQCC282 Emile Henry Red Bread Cloche]] so I was pleased to see new instructions for proofing and baking in clay bakers or a covered cast-iron pot). Like any baking book worth its salt, recipes are given in (volume, weight, and metric measurements. New (and appreciated) additions include Crock Pot Bread, Wurzelbrot (Swiss Twisted Bread), Wisconsin beer cheese bread, and some much-needed gluten-free loaves such as sweet brioche and fruit-and-nut spiral rolls. The new step-by-step photos for many of the loaves are a huge help in properly shaping and assembling the more intricate loaves. For those looking for a caloric splurge, the book does sinful things with enriched doughs (the caramel pecan rolls are the best I've ever tried / made; I usually use the no-knead brioche dough as the base and double the topping / filling to make two pans; the chocolate raisin babka has 16 egg yolks).

I could sympathize with Scout's (Jean Louise) conflicted feelings as she revisited her home, and discovered new sides to the people she loved.  These were the most interesting parts of the book.  But the conversations with Uncle Jack got really tedious -- if I met the man in person, he would be annoying at least, and might even seem to be mentally unhinged.  His endless literary and historical references added little to the story at hand.  Calpurnia?  We see her for about two pages -- disappointing.  And Atticus?  I just don't know how to feel about him -- and a better book would have more clearly explained his feelings and motivations.  I kept hoping this book would wrap things up nicely.

4.0,A nice companion piece to the French and Italian Slow Cooker books; shines for desserts,"I own both of Michele's [[ASIN:054700303X The Italian Slow Cooker]] and [[ASIN:0547508042 The French Slow Cooker]] books, and they are in frequent rotation in my [[ASIN:B0026A7GRM Hamilton Beach Premiere Cookware 5-1/2-Quart Slow Cooker]] for their winning combination of authentic flavors and relatively easy prep.I preordered her latest, Mediterranean Slow Cooker, and quickly bookmarked several recipes that caught my eye. In the French Slow Cooker, Michele demystified soufflés for the slow cooker. Here, you'll find a variety of egg dishes like spinach and feta omelet, spicy vegetable eggah, Israeli breakfast favorite shakshouka, and a delicate green bean and scallion torta that would all make fantastic brunch options.The poached salmon in court-bouillon was a winner, especially when paired with the suggested tzatziki, and the shrimp with tomatoes and feta (my personal preference was to switch out the white wine in the sauce for red) was also a favorite. The crunchy mustard chicken diable has the ingenious solution of slow-cooking bone-in chicken thighs, then toasting panko on the stove and coating the chicken at the last minute so the topping remains crunchy (this would make a great picnic dish!). And the pork ragu with broken lasagna Maialino-style was an unexpected gem; the simple sauce is served over irregular sheets of lasagna noodles tossed with Parmigiano and arugula. Fans of lamb will find plenty to rejoice over, including numerous Greek recipes like Bandits' Lamb (stuffed with salty Greek cheese) and Middle Eastern lamb and pine nut meatballs.Vegetarians will also find some offerings, such as red lentil soup, winter squash and chickpea soup, polenta with herbs, wheat berry tabbouleh, bulgur and toasted walnut pilaf, and farro with spring vegetables. Like her other slow cooker cookbooks, you'll also find ""out of the pot"" recipes that use precooked beans, etc.; here these offerings include a Greek country chickpea salad, hummus, and Turkish beet and goat cheese dip.For me, the real star of the book was the desserts. The entire section is crammed full of intriguing finds, like several Greek-inspired cakes (sunny orange cake with orange syrup, walnut cake with cinnamon syrup), decadent cheesecakes (the first recipe I tried was the awesome cannoli cheesecake; see above for a photo) including Nutella, several flans, bread puddings, and fruit (blushing pomegranate pears, warm fruit compote with mascarpone sauce).This is a worthy investment if you enjoy Italian, Spanish, and Greek food, and most of the ingredients should be easy to find at your local supermarket. Yes, there is some prep involved in the chopping and sautéing of veggies (and browning of meat) before cooking, but this adds a wealth of flavor to the final dish that is well worth the extra time (and if you have a slow cooker with a metal insert, you can sauté and cook in the same dish). The desserts alone are worth the cost of the book; Michele taught me that I can make showstopping cheesecakes in my slow cooker, a trick I never would have thought to try on my own! (I used [[ASIN:B000237FS0 Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch]] set on a [[ASIN:B005FPD6VA Spice Ratchet 16812 Blossom Multi-Use Silicone Trivet, Black]]).**Update 1/20: In addition to the cannoli cheesecake, I've also made the sunny orange cake with orange syrup (which is basically a revani or basbousa, in this case lightened by folding in whipped egg whites), coffee flan, and the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake (see photos above). Maybe it's just my particular slow cooker, but I found that my cakes baked much more quickly than the suggested times, so check at least 30 minutes before the book times to play it safe.***Update 5/26: I have also tried the roasted beets and beet and goat cheese dip, basic recipe for chickpeas and the country chickpea salad and hummus, and next up is the coconut flan (everybody RAVES about the coffee caramel flan, so I wanted to try the variation!).

4.0,A gripping read,"Jennifer Lynn Barnes' ""Raised by Wolves"" is a fast-paced look at Were pack life from the view of an outsider. Bronwyn Alessia St. Vincent Clare (Bryn for short) is a tough-as-nails teenager raised by a pack of werewolves. Unlike them, she's fully human, but alpha male Callum has Marked her as his and taken her under his wing. Like any teenager, she chafes against many of Callum's restrictions (tough physical training, curfews, keeping up good grades) and just wants to be left alone to work on her artwork. Bryn carefully shields herself from the Pack's shared thoughts and feral urges, especially during the full moon, and generally doesn't intervene in Pack matters, but when an outside threat tears open old wounds, Bryn must examine her allegiances to the Pack and the definition of ""family."" She's obsessed with Chase, a fellow Were attack survivor, and will do anything to spend time with him, even if it risks her standing in the Pack.Much of the first half of the book focuses on Pack hierarchy and Pack mentality (the Weres are able to tune into each other's thoughts collectively both as Wolf and human). Bryn's best friend Devon comes off a bit like a token character from Glee...he's a meticulously-groomed Were who lives for movie musicals and belting out showtunes. Bryn's other friend Lake Mitchell lives out-of-state on the periphery of Callum's territory and is a frontier gunslinger. She has the unpleasant distinction of being one of only a handful of female Weres...and the author alludes to some past sexual trauma related to this. The second half focuses on Bryn's hunt for a rogue Were, and the pace picks up considerably.Barnes' writing style vaults between human thoughts and werewolf ones (generally disjointed, in brief bursts of ideas). There are also numerous episodes of graphic violence related to the central plot; it's definitely gorier than a lot of other YA werewolf fiction I've read. Curiously enough, despite the intensely physical nature of Weres, most of the story is asexual. The author definitely treads into some New Age territory with psychic mind melding and being able to see the future, and I would have liked more physical descriptions of the Change (an area that [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]] fleshed out nicely) that Weres undergo.  Also, the final 30 pages felt a bit anticlimactic and like a setup for an obligatory sequel.Overall, this is an engrossing read that fans of werewolf lore will enjoy.",2010-07-04 00:15:01.000,3.0,False,Books,en,negative,0.925788164138794,0.988685131072998,[],1.0

3.0,"A lot of great info, but the text-heavy layout makes for difficult reading","I've done a lot of travel around Europe and Japan and have relied upon a wide variety of guidebooks including Fodors, Moon, Eyewitness Travel, Rick Steves and Lonely Planet. Accurate and timely cultural info is one of the first things I look for, along with detailed descriptions of local cuisine, off-the-beaten path suggestions, and a clean layout with clear maps. I write and design technical books for a living, so I tend to look at layout from a publisher's perspective (fonts, readability, choice of graphics and placement).I've used several Lonely Planet guidebooks in the last two years, so when I opened Lonely Planet Croatia, I was surprised to see the lack of graphics. The only color photos to be found in 346 pages of text are in the first 30 pages. The extremely monochromatic and text-heavy design (printed in a small font) makes for laborious reading (to compare, I read this side by side with [[ASIN:1612381901 Rick Steves' Croatia and Slovenia]], which was inviting and made for fascinating reading cover to cover). This is unfortunate, because there is a wealth of information here: historical and cultural background on Croatia, including a very detailed timeline from 300BC to the present, architecture in Croatia, the environment, etc., but I found I only able to read in limited increments and had to come back to the book later.Descriptions for individual sights / attractions are generally very thorough, labeling each (art gallery, museum, cemetery, etc.). Restaurant options include local Croatian food as well as a mix of international at a range of prices.  There's a young and hip vibe; you'll find sidebars on beach clubbing and the hottest bars. You'll also find handy survival info (local internet access, laundry, medical services, etc.) for each destination as well as a survival guide (with the interesting suggestion of volunteering at a local vulture center or a refuge for young bears) and a whirlwind overview of Croatian. One nice feature is that Lonely Planet Croatia goes into much more detail into areas not frequently visited on group tours (i.e., inland Croatia away from the Dalmatian Coast, such as Slavonia and Zagorje.If the layout had been broken up differently (including more color graphics to break up the monotony of the small font), I feel that this would have been more user friendly. There is a lot of good info here,  but it tends to get lost in the fray. There is also no separate pull-out map as with other Lonely Planet titles I've purchased. For my trip to Croatia, I'll be sticking with [[ASIN:1612381901 Rick Steves' Croatia and Slovenia]].",2013-07-24 01:28:35.000,2.0,False,Books,en,negative,0.5421339869499207,0.5253917574882507,[],5.0
5.0,Haunting and evocative,"Jenna Blum's ""Those Who Save Us"" chronicles the Holocaust-era journey of Anna Schlemmer, beginning in 1939, as she navigates the treacherous waters of everyday life in the Third Reich and makes difficult choices in order to survive, choices that will haunt her fifty years later even after she escapes Germany as a war bride in 1945 and settles in Minnesota.Anna's daughter Gertrude, Trudy for short, is a tenured professor of history specializing in German women's roles during WWII. Aloof and obsessively clean, Trudy begins a German Project to try and interview immigrant Germans who lived through WWII, to capture the experience of ordinary German civilians even as her colleague Ruth records the memories of Holocaust survivors with the same grant money. Trudy must also care for her aging mother after her father's death; Anna is silent about the war, and Trudy's only clues come from twisted dreams and shards of memories of her early years in Germany, and a single forbidden photograph of a young Trudy, Anna, and an unknown SS officer. She searches desperately for the key to unlock Anna's silence about the SS officer that Trudy remembers as Saint Nicholas.The story alternates between Anna's wartime experiences from 1939 to 1945 and Trudy, circa 1997, as she struggles to uncover the truth behind her mother's unending silence, to unearth Anna's sacrifices to ensure her survival even as German civilians were starving to death towards the end of the war. Trudy has inherited her mother's sense of distance, her cold detachment, and is utterly alone, unable to freely love. The narrative device works well, and the two women bear threads of similarity in their personalities although their narrative voices are distinct.Poignantly told, ""Those Who Save Us"" gently examines seemingly small choices that haunt us decades after their perpetration, probes the depths of human depravity, and untangles the threads that connect us to our past. The novel is filled with evocative smells; Anna worked in a bakery, and the pages are dusted with flour and the cloying sweetness of marzipan and chocolate as Anna bakes furiously to exorcise the ghosts of her past. Blum does an admirable job of simply painting the stage; she allows the story to speak for itself. We are shown both sides of the Holocaust, from snippets of the Resistance and prisoner networks to the coldhearted SS elite that perpetrate unspeakable crimes and those ordinary German citizens who aided them if only to delay their own deaths. Anna's own harsh judgment of her wartime choices is far more punishing than the shunning the superstitious citizens of her new adopted town can mete out. Evocative and haunting, I couldn't put ""Those Who Save Us"" down until the final climactic truths had spilled out and the final pieces had slid into place.",2008-12-20 13:17:44.000,2.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.7947716116905212,0.9384434223175049,[],5.0

4.0,A celebration of food from land and sea,"I’ve been blessed to teach hundreds of students from the Middle East, who generously shared their culture, cuisine and stories over tiny porcelain cups of cardamom-scented Arabic coffee, dates from royal orchards, and rosewater-soaked pastries, and “Baladi” captures the essence of Palestine in a beautifully tangible way that pays tributes to Palestine’s farmers, fishermen, bakers, market sellers, and ordinary daily family life – you will certainly want to add this to your cookbook collection and it is one of my top cookbooks of 2018.I previously reviewed Joudie Kalla’s love song “Palestine on a Plate” in January 2017 when I quickly fell in love with the brilliant recipes and remembrances of her family’s kitchen. In her sophomore “Baladi: Palestine: A Celebration of Food from Land and Sea,” Joudie again pays homage to her homeland of Palestine, this time by taking readers to small villages, farms, orchards, markets and experiencing the changing seasons and various cuisines.The word “Baladi” means “My home, my land, my country.” Despite its small size, Palestine is home to a wide range of terrains, including uninhabited desert and cold areas along the northern border, with access to the sea and rivers as well as an abundance of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs. Because of its prime location on a trade route crossing multiple borders, there are also other international influences on Palestinian cuisine which “makes us all family in the end.”Market life is central to traditional Palestinian culture and dictates the day’s menu, as many still shop daily and buy whatever is freshest. In the market chapter, you’ll find turmeric mlik with cracked cardamom pods, Arabic coffee, the incredibly simple yet indulgent grape molasses and tahini spread (the Palestinian equivalent to the PB&J of our youth!), the fantastic fryup of grilled halloumi, fried eggs, and roasted tomatoes, mixed vegetable salad with tahini dressing, soft-boiled eggs with yogurt, chili and lemon, fried eggplant slices with honey and tahini, watermelon, feta and red onion with mint, and hummus (the entire first chapter is basically a vegetarian’s dream menu).“The Fields and Earth” offers up an abundant harvest of veggies served every way: fried okra with chili, roasted beets,  sautéed, caramelized (the caramelized shallots with herby labneh was a revelation!), served kubbeh-style, fresh salads (goat cheese, dates, and endives pair spectacularly), and lemon potatoes.s a baker at heart, my heart sang at the wide range of stuffed pastries and homemade breads like khubez (pita), Mai’s Akkawi Bread liberally coated in za’atar and stuffed with salty white cheese, za’atar and feta brioche twists, fatayer, and dumplings.“The farm” delights meat eaters with ample recipes for lamb and poultry, while the seas and rivers offer arak-poached salmon, marinated sardines, shatta-marinated sea bass with crushed rose petals, fish skewers, fried fish, and kataifi-wrapped shrimp.“Hills and orchards” uses the abundance of the harvest to create watermelon juice with mint and orange blossom (I got hooked on fresh watermelon juice living in Taiwan, and there is no better cure for summer heat and humidity), fresh pomegranate and mango juice, strawberry, orange blossom, and rose jam, apple and pistachio jam, preserved lemons, pickled olives, baklawa, filo pastries filled with sweetened cream, rose and pistachio eclairs, the endangered tamriyeh, khafeh cheesecake, pistachio, zucchini, and lemon cake, black sesame cake, chocolate and labneh cake with slivered pistachios, qatayef, tahini halva, and gorgeous, dramatic ice cream roulades.Recipe names are given in English and Arabic in both metric and US measurements.The book is illustrated throughout with luscious food photography by Jamie Orlando Smith, stunning photography of Palestine’s diverse landscapes as well as scenes from daily life (working the farm, pulling noodles, carrying in the day’s catch), gorgeous table settings, and Palestinian embroidery.

4.0,"A nice addition to ""Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day,"" but not as versatile","When [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first came out, it revolutionized my bread baking. Before, I would use my Cuisinart bread machine once or twice a month, but with ""Artisan Bread in 5,"" I would bake at least once a week using the book's no-knead method to produce brioche, challah, and caramel pecan rolls that rivaled those from my local bakery. When the sequel [[ASIN:0312545525 Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day: 100 New Recipes Featuring Whole Grains, Fruits, Vegetables, and Gluten-Free Ingredients]] came out, I found fewer recipes that appealed to me; most of the ""whole-grain"" recipes still called for large amounts of refined white flour and added wheat gluten.So when I saw ""Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day,"" I was willing to give it a shot. Normally, I'll just purchase frozen pizza dough, so I was looking forward to making my own using the same method I'd had success with for breads and rolls. Be forewarned: the book is primarily a pizza dough book, with numerous variations on the master dough recipe (""00"" flour, which is what is used in Italy for pizza and pasta), semolina, whole wheat, spelt, cornmeal olive oil) and various international breads like naan (there was a naan recipe in the first ""Artisan Bread in 5,"" but this one includes the tenderizing addition of yogurt), chapati, homemade tortillas (corn and flour), and injera.The pizza sauces are more of an afterthought to the dough; the basic ""tomato topping"" consists of ""four 14.5-ounce or two 28-ounce cans crushed or diced tomatoes: the world's simplest pizza topping."" The homemade barbecue sauce is a winner, though, with its complex flavor profile of orange juice, dark brown sugar, chili powder and paprika in addition to tomatoes, onion, ketchup and vinegar. You'll also find recipes for pesto, bechamel, and tomatillo sauce. The pizza recipes themselves include some interesting combinations like curried sweet potato, lentil and arugula, Brussels sprouts, smoked pancetta and pecorino, and rainbow beet pizza. Instructions for cooking pizza on an outdoor grill are also included. The cheesy breadsticks are easy to throw together and are far superior to most chain restaurants' breadsticks.In addition to the pizzas and flatbreads, there's also a nice assortment of easy-to-make Mediterranean dips, including hummus (their version uses 1/2 cup tahini, which results in a silky-smooth texture), baba ghanoush, the underappreciated ajvar (a Croatian spread made from roasted red peppers), the Greek dips tzatziki and skordalia, Italian caponata, and French tapenade, that are perfect to whip together for an informal get-together. There are a few substantial soups with international flair, including curried lentil soup, Cuban black bean soup, Scandinavian fish soup, and Spanish Galician Potato Soup with Greens and Chorizo. The desserts are kind of an afterthought and definitely one of the weaker points of the book.Like most good baking books, ingredients are measured by volume (U.S.) and U.S. and metric weights. For baking, weighing is more accurate than volume, since flour can absorb moisture (and thus become denser), altering the amount of flour on a dry vs. humid day. My advance reader copy has relatively few black-and-white photos, so I can't comment on the final printing, but what step-by-step photos are provided are helpful.Bottom line: if you're new to the 5-minute, no-knead method (this is NOT the same one as [[ASIN:0393066304 My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method]] or [[ASIN:1118169433 Kneadlessly Simple: Fabulous, Fuss-Free, No-Knead Breads]], as you're not baking the bread at very high heat inside a Dutch oven), I recommend picking up [[ASIN:0312362919 Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking]] first, as it's simply more versatile than ""Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day."" If you're looking specifically for practical pizza dough recipes, then this is the book for you!P.S.: It's well worth the investment to purchase a baking stone, pizza peel and [[ASIN:B002PMV77G Cambro RFS6PPSW2190 6-Quart Round Food-Storage Container with Lid, Set of 2]] to help you get started.

5.0,"“Dear, if you make it with love, it will be delicious.” Welcome to Alice's Kitchen!","An accomplished writer and artist, Linda Dalal Sawaya’s family immigrated from Douma, Lebanon to Detroit in 1926; her grandmother Dalal and mother Alice Ganamey Sawaya, mother of five, grandmother of seven, great-grandmother of nine, soon became famous for their cooking, and as the youngest of five daughters, Linda later became their kitchen assistant. In “Alice’s Kitchen” (now in its fourth edition), Linda lovingly collects family portraits, memories, and over 100 traditional Lebanese dishes including mezza, salads, kebabs, stuffed veggies, and delicate desserts that capture the essence of Lebanon’s healthful, veggie-centric cuisine in a simple, easily approachable format. In addition, a portion of the proceeds benefits the children of Lebanon.Linda, her artwork, and “Alice’s Kitchen” were featured prominently in an issue of the excellent magazine “Aramco World,” and Linda was kind enough to send a copy of the issue “Memories of a Lebanese Garden,” which features stunning cover paintings of the author and her mother in a garden filled with classic Lebanese imagery and produce as well as full-page paintings of scenes from Douma, the author learning to toss bread in the air like her mother and grandmother before her, family portraits, and illustrated ingredients for the featured recipes (‘ihjee, sambusak, mujaddrah, kusah mahshi, salatat bandurah Elis).Linda’s grandmother Dalal had lived through WWI, rationing, single parenting and a historic earthquake before joining her husband in Detroit; having survived these hardships, she taught her children and grandchildren the art of recycling, conversation and not wasting even a single grain of rice. Moving to the US meant that new culinary skills had to be learned – where the town butcher in Douma had previously prepared various cuts of lamb, this was a luxury not available in 1950s Los Angeles, so Alice and Dalal learned to cut legs of lamb for various dishes, and how to bake their own bread (huge, paper-thin loaves). Linda grew up surrounded by an abundance of food, prepared not only for the family but also any visitors that happened to drop by, a hallmark of Lebanese hospitality. Her family kept a small kitchen garden where they grew mint, purslane, squash, grape leaves, and figs.Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Alice, I feel as though I know her through reading Linda’s stories and through the black and white photographs; my own grandmother was named Alice and also immigrated to Michigan (in my case, from Poland in 1913). She similarly preserved and passed down her heritage through her love of cooking and feeding family, so “Alice’s Kitchen” resonated deeply with me on many levels far beyond a simple culinary connection. As a child, I remember my grandmother recounting arriving at Ellis Island; when I finally made it to Ellis Island in 1914 during a job interview in NYC, it was a highly charged emotional moment to see it from the ferry for the first time, just as my grandmother must have seen it. Now as an adult, I am attempting to reconnect with my immigrant heritage by trying to recapture the taste of my grandmother’s home cooking. (Unlike Linda, I was not fortunate enough to preserve my grandmother’s recipes or to learn from her in the kitchen while she was still alive).Having grown up surrounded by her family’s Lebanese cuisine in Los Angeles, Linda had the chance to finally experience Lebanon’s culture and legendary hospitality for herself during a three-month sojourn in 1971. Suddenly familiar rituals and flavors that she’d taken for granted took on new meaning; the artistry that her mother Alice incorporated was evident in every dish. This first encounter with Lebanon transformed her life and provided the starting point for “Alice’s Kitchen.”Opening with a very helpful guide to “About the Recipes,” you’ll find a section on curing olives and pickling (green, black, pickled turnips and vegetables), homemade cheese, yogurt and butter (including Arabic cheese, labne, and clarified butter), sauces (yogurt garlic, tahini, za’atar with olive oil). Salads are probably my favorite part of Lebanese cuisine, and you’ll find familiar favorites like fattoush and tabbouli alongside Salatat Elias (tomato salad with garlic and spearmint), yogurt and cucumber, and Lebanese potato salad.As lamb is a central component to many Lebanese dishes, there is an excellent illustrated guide to breaking down various cuts (leg, breast, shoulder) and many excellent serving suggestions (shish kebab, grilled ground lamb, meat pies, and the national dish, kibbe nayye (raw minced lamb and bulgur). Chicken and fish dishes will give you additional ideas for mains.Being vegetarian, of course my favorite section was vegetarian entrees and vegetables, beans, and grains. Lebanese cuisine lends itself particularly well to vegetarian dishes such as mjaddrah (lentils and rice with caramelized onions, fatayir (spinach pies), ‘ijjeh (omelette with parsley, mint and onion), summer squash stuffed with rice, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, falafel and vegetarian kibbe. As a fan of both pumpkin and bulgur, the kibbet jlunt (baked pumpkin and bulgur with pine nuts) was a revelation. Her version of Mhammara (grilled red pepper and walnut dip) is superb; just the right degree of tart (from lemon juice and pomegranate molasses) with a little kick from the chili paste (I used Tunisian harissa), this addictive dip goes perfectly with veggies, pita, feta, and basically anything you can think of! And you’ll find the full range of wonderful Middle Eastern desserts, from walnut ma’amoul, ‘atayif (crepes with cheese or walnut filling), knafe, a delicately spiced rice pudding, and baklava rounded out with suggested drinks. There’s even a section on homemade preserves and fruit leathers (fig jam with aniseed and walnuts, quince, apricot, and pumpkin and carrot infused with rose geranium petals.Recipe names are given in transliterated Arabic as well as English (Arabic titles are listed in italics in the index). Each recipe is introduced with a brief background into the dish, its importance in traditional Lebanese cuisine or preparation and serving tips, and family stories and traditions. A handy glossary breaks down Arabic terms for cooking, tools, ingredients, terms of endearments and hospitality, and sample menus for breakfast, lunch, mezza, dinner, and more.Here is Linda’s fabulous recipe for Mhammara:3 red bell peppers, roasted or grilled until blackened (I used one jar drained roasted red peppers)1 cup walnuts1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses1 tablespoon chili paste (I used harissa)3 cloves of garlic2 tablespoons lemon juice1 teaspoon salt½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional – I skipped it)2 tablespoons sesame seeds (I used toasted)2 tablespoons bread crumbs (or more as needed)1. Place whole red peppers over a grill, or broil until blackened. This takes only a few minutes. Put hot peppers into a paper bag and close to cool. This makes them easy to peel. Under running water, remove all the blackened skin. Cut in half and remove seeds. Juices from the peppers can be used in the dip.2. Put peppers and all of the remaining ingredients into a food processor and pulse just until the consistency is minced but not pureed.3. Taste and add seasonings or bread crumbs as needed. Serve with Arabic bread, pita chips, or crackers.Makes 2 cups of dip, serving 8 to 10 for appetizers.Overall, Alice’s Kitchen is a book I will be turning to again and again to make the most of summer’s bounty through simple, delicious recipes that preserve the unique flavors of the fruits and veggies that star in them.As Linda so eloquently puts it, the appeal of traditional Lebanese cuisine is that “Our tradition is about living gently on the earth. Using resources of the earth respectfully. Sharing and preparing food with love. Eating what is in season. Growing our own food as much as possible. Living simply and richly. Honoring the earth. Honoring ourselves and each other. This is my gesture to honor and preserve that culture for myself, for my family, and for others who appreciate these traditions, values, and foods.” As Linda’s mother Alice described it, “Dear, if you make it with love, it will be delicious.” Sallem dayetkoom!(A heartfelt shukran (thank you) to Linda for the review copy of Alice’s Kitchen, postcard featuring her original oil paintings, and copy of the January / February 1997 Aramco World magazine she was the cover story on.)",2016-05-25 10:11:20.000,2.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.9679974913597107,0.9712287783622742,['books'],5.0

3.0,"No new revelations, but still enjoyable","I've eagerly followed all of Kathy Reichs's Tempe Brennan novels beginning with [[ASIN:1416570985 Deja Dead: 10th Anniversary Edition (Temperance Brennan Novels)]], and Devil Bones, the eleventh in the series, fails to break any new ground, although it's another enjoyable outing with Tempe and her work.This time around, Tempe's in Charlotte examining the links between two headless bodies, as well as the origins of a human skull discovered on a hidden altar in a rundown house. There are hints of witchcraft: santeria, voodoo, and Wiccans are all fingered as possible culprits in the beginning. Tempe's Montreal boyfriend Andrew Ryan is out of the picture, but a former flame, son of a legendary NBA star, is definitely interested in her (and the case). And someone wants Tempe off the case enough to leave dead copperheads on her doorstep.Those who thrilled to Tempe's love life will be sorely disappointed; also, contrary to former books, Tempe's soundly thudded off the AA bandwagon. And Tempe's daughter Katy makes only token appearances. Devil Bones moved slowly, and it felt as though there was very little substance filling out the pages. If you enjoyed reading about Quebecois culture in earlier books, Tempe spends zero time in Montreal this time around. The connections between the various cases were tenuous at best, although Reichs manages to create wonderfully evocative atmospheres.Reichs ""Wiccan 101"" chapter was just painful; here we have a group of touchy-feely societal outcasts with names like Raven and Dreamweaver instructed to ""Kiss your knuckles. Kiss your fingers. You are love!"" I was just waiting for a stirring round of Kumbaya and fuzzy puppies to top off the love-yourself lovefest. Ouch.On the whole, Devil Bones was an improvement over Cross Bones, and it's good to be back for the ride. Devil Bones was a quick, enjoyable read, but not one of my favorite Tempe books ([[ASIN:1416570985 Deja Dead: 10th Anniversary Edition (Temperance Brennan Novels)]] still has that honour for nailing Quebecois culture spot-on).",2008-08-31 01:27:00.000,0.0,False,Books,af,positive,0.8358781933784485,0.9344286322593689,[],3.0

4.0,If you're looking for more challenging counted cross stitch...,"You're sure to find it in Jan Eaton's Famous Paintings in Cross Stitch. I first discovered this delightful book in the British cross stitch magazine Cross Stitch Gold, which featured a full color pattern based on Rossetti's ""La Ghirlandata,"" and spent the next two years trying to track down a copy of this excellent book. Note to self: why is it that all decent cross stitch magazines / books are English and super-expensive?!The book features fifteen projects based on paintings by Van Gogh (Irises), Klimpt, Mucha, Degas, Cezanna and Botticelli. Some of the projects, such as a Degas tote bag, are smaller and more manageable, while other large-scale projects such as Van Gogh's Irises and La Ghirlandata will keep you stitching for months, if not years.I wasn't as fond of the smaller projects; a Mucha-inspired curtain border paled next to the original print it was taken from, the Japanese woodblock print seemed a bit tired, and I noticed through careful comparison that the Degas tote bag insert featured an incomplete pattern (if you compare it to the photo, you'll see an area of shading under the ballerina that is coded in the legend, but not present on the chart). Generally, charts were easy on the eye and easy to read, although as previously mentioned, I found at least one instance where the chart and final project photo differed.Overall, if you feel like you've conquered easier projects and you're looking for something unique, try Famous Paintings In Cross Stitch for a Mona Lisa-inspired eyeglass case, delicate sachets, greeting cards and large-scale projects that your visitors will ooh and aah over.",2008-03-14 02:40:49.000,7.0,True,Books,en,positive,0.9351528286933899,0.9510160088539124,[],5.0

4.0,"Bold, in your face, and full of love - Modern Israeli Cooking","I am a huge fan of Israeli cuisine and have read numerous cookbooks in the last several years focusing on this diverse cuisine, so I was excited to be offered &#34;Modern Israeli Cooking&#34; by Danielle Oron, the creative force behind Moo Milk Bar and the blog &#34;I Will Not East Oysters.&#34; Danielle's family moved from Tel Aviv to New Jersey when she was a toddler, and her family was known as &#34;those crazy Israelis.&#34; In her words, these recipes combine her culinary background in French technique with classic Israeli flavors to create new and modern dishes.Modern Israel is a melting pot; you'll find cuisine from Morocco, Eastern Europe, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and Turkey. Dishes are served family-style with a lot of side plates consisting of salads and dips; this is my personal culinary heaven. The recipes are divided into weekdays (chicken shawarma rice bowl, kofta kebab freekeh salad, za'atar chicken, pashtida), Fridays (challah, ricotta and za'atar ravioli, lemon chicken with olives, harissa lamb meatballs), beach (peel and eat harissa shrimp - if you haven't guessed already, this is NOT a kosher cookbook), salmon ceviche, chermoula fish tacos, seared sesame tuna), slow cooking (braised pomegranate short ribs, roasted garli and apricot chicken, hawaij oxtail ragu, pastrami), brunch (shakshuka, bourekas, babka French toast, za'atar sesame mini bagels), midnight (za'atar fried eggs, feta grilld cheese, cinnamon challah), salads and sides (tabbouleh, carrots several ways, pickled beets), sweets (saled tahini chocolate chip cookies, tahini-swirled brownies, halva morning buns, honey and apple cake), and stapes (tahini, ancho chili harissa, labne, schug, preserved lemons, dukkah). Ingredients are given in US (volume) and metric.Danielle's commentary is on the hip side; recipe subtitles frequently involve food puns and cultural insights, like the mild red pepper harissa: &#34;If you like the flavor, but you have a death wish / enjoy S&M, add more of the Thai chilis and a bit more hot paprika.&#34;) or tahini: &#34;We put this sh*t on everything.&#34;True to the book's goal, you will find classic flavors with modern twists; the beloved sabich has been turned into a breakfast bowl with shredded potato hash, falafel gets some help from spinach and is served with green tahini and sauerkraut, you'll find Sephardic pastries like bourekas supersized and dressed up with mushrooms and caramelized onions, Milky has been reinvented as a decadent, boozy pot de creme. I loved the peppered watermelon and feta, as watermelon + mint + Bulgarian feta is a staple breakfast in my house; here, Korean red pepper flakes and black pepper kick this up a notch.Overall this is a fun, young take on modern Israeli cooking - you'll find many familiar flavor profiles (za'atar, tahini, sumac, schug, dukkah) and plenty of colorful veggie salads and sides to dress up your table. From a comfort food perspective, it contains the most amazing grilled cheese recipe (feta grilled with Kalamata olives - heaven!), eggs and sumac soldiers, and many warming dishes that would be great for cooler nights (braised pomegranate short ribs, sweet shredded honey lamb, beer-braised holiday brisket, homemade pastrami).*For those who keep kosher, please note that this is NOT a kosher cookbook - it contains shellfish recipes as well as meat mixed with dairy. However, most of the recipes are (or can be made) kosher with a little tweaking.",2015-11-09 01:38:08.000,16.0,False,Books,en,positive,0.9676018953323364,0.8738090395927429,[],4.0

This expanded edition of ""Food of Life"" is rich with Persian poetry (written in Farsi as well as translated into English) that complements various ingredients, recipes, and lifecycle events. You'll find witty retellings of Mulla Nasruddin that combine food and humor, as well as excerpts from the Thousand and One Nights and early Persian literature. There are also detailed descriptions of various holidays in Iran, as well as the traditional Iranian wedding ceremony with suggestions on how to plan your own. Gorgeous illustrations including miniatures, manuscripts, and reproductions from bas-reliefs provide a glimpse of Persian culture throughout the ages, including lavish court feasts. The food photography is also beautiful, featuring traditional Persian sofrehs and accents. For those new to Persian cuisine, a wonderful list of sample menus is included that covers main meals, Persian holidays and lifecycle events (you'll even find a suggested Persian-American hybrid Thanksgiving menu featuring sweet and sour stuffed turkey and pumpkin khoresh).The recipes are clearly laid out (vegetarian substitutions are printed in green in the margins where applicable) and easy to follow, and I appreciated the thorough glossary of ingredients, terms and Persian cooking techniques, the bilingual English-Farsi list of ingredients and common trees, plants and flowers, as well as the updated list of Iranian stores and restaurants (including internet stores). Though there are certain ingredients that will have to be mail ordered (golpar, grape syrup, dried Persian limes, dried rose petals, mahlab, etc.), most recipes call for ingredients that should be readily available at your grocery store or butcher. Persian cuisine tends to use a large variety of fresh and dried herbs and seasonal vegetables, making it a great way to use up produce from your farmer's market or CSA. I particularly loved the opening chapter of appetizers and side dishes; I like to make two or three and serve them as a light dinner. There are many healthy, tasty yogurt-based dips and salads such as yogurt, cucumber and rose petal dip, yogurt and spinach dip, and yogurt and white broad bean salad as well as cheese, walnut and herb dip, olive salads, and light veggie salads. Stuffed vegetables also play an important role in Persian cooking; I loved the vegetarian version of the quinces with rice stuffing (delightfully sweet-tart from the grape molasses, balsamic vinegar, and lime juice), the stuffed eggplants with walnut and onion stuffing, and the potatoes stuffed with eggs and fresh herbs.Kukus, or open-faced omelets, are another versatile staple that can be served as a snack, appetizer or main dish. They can be served hot or cold and hold in the fridge for several days, making them perfect for a quick leftover meal with a salad. I loved the apple, raisin, and date omelet: I used Fuji apples (but left out the optional cayenne), and I loved the hint of rosewater in the batter. I also tried the pistachio kuku with its side salad of heart of Romaine and dill; I would have never thought to make an omelet with nuts (you grind them with sugar in the food processor first, so there are no large chunks), but it was a very pleasant discovery. Instructions are also included for finishing the omelet in the oven rather than the stovetop (I found that my Le Creuset 10"" cast iron skillet was perfect for this).Another revelation was the fish baked in yogurt with walnut and dill topping. The yogurt kept the fish wonderfully moist, while the walnut topping made with fresh herbs and bread crumbs added a wonderful crunch. There are numerous variations for kababs including lamb, veal, fish, and organ meats, as well as an incredibly thorough  chapter on rice dishes, chelows and polows with fantastic step-by-step photos on how to prepare the tahdig, the golden crust at the bottom of the rice pot that is the most prized part, with no fewer than seven variations. There are even instructions on how to make Persian rice in a rice cooker, a handy touch for busy modern cooks. Polows are one of my favorite things to make as I regularly have many spices and dried fruits on hand, and the many variations using seasonal fruits such as apples and quince make for lots of happy exploring.As a baker, I particularly enjoyed the chapters on desserts, pastries and candies and breads. One of my favorite discoveries was the Armenian sweet bread; I found I had all the ingredients on hand (I used ghee in place of butter) and substituted cardamom for mahlab, and the three resulting loaves looked just like those pictured (see above for photo). Due to it being a very rich dough, the bread does not rise much, but the moist crumb was delicately scented with cardamom and just sweet enough (I used pearl sugar as a garnish). It also freezes well for last-minute company. Chapters on preserves and pickles, drinks (including tea, coffee, and flavored syrups), and snacks and street foods round out the offerings.This beautiful anniversary edition of ""Food of Life"" captures the essence of Iran both ancient and modern, and the book brims with poetry, grace, and the joy of a good meal with family and friends. This is a beautiful tribute to Persian cuisine and culture; the scent of saffron and rosewater seems to rise from its pages, and I find myself coming back to its recipes and stories again and again. ""Food of Life"" holds a place of honor in my cookbook collection, and I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well.

Nik Tyndall offers the  listener a glimpse of a floating mysterious paradise with Moments, Shiho  reworks the Japanese folksong song Sakura into a shimmering cascade of  notes on her electric koto, Al Gromer Khan blends the sounds of India  (sitar, tabla) with modern technology for a breathtaking effect.  A  number of the CD's that are featured on this sampler such as Lagoon by Nik  Tyndall and Shiho's album have gone out of print, their only available  songs being on Universe Sampler 90.  Although this CD dates from the  early 1990's, there is still a great deal of memorable music available  here. Images are conjured out of the depths of the imagination. This album  still remains my favourite after eight or so years for its groundbreaking  approach to New Age music.",2000-03-16 13:38:28.000,40.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.9216108322143555,0.9057273864746094,[],5.0
5.0,Simply amazing,"From the first second of the first track I was drawn in. Oceania is overflowing with energy and respect for the old ways and uses traditional Maori instruments such as the pahu (drum), pukaea (trumpet), koauau  (flute), and the putaatara (a conch shell played like a trumpet) and the  Maori language. Each track was fresh and invigorating, offering something  new with each listen. The voice of Hinewehi Mohi is otherworldly, perfectly  suited to the haunting music of Jaz Coleman and Hirini Melbourne. The final  result is a seamless blend of voices, instruments, and modern sounds as  well. In the end Oceania seems more organic than electronic.Also  touching are the two songs that were written for Hineraukatauri, Hine's  daughter, who was born with cerebral palsy. The first, Hineraukatauri, is a  beautiful ode to motherhood and its unconditional love. The second, Pepepe,  was a poem written in English and then translated into Maori with beautiful  results (""You are as fragile as the harmony in the laughter of a waterway/  the crystalline melody of your song/ we will wait for it to enchant us."").

5.0,Another standout performance from Violaine Corradai and CdS,"With Varekai, Cirque du Soleil's newest production, Violaine Corradai has conjured a mesmerizing blend of world influences and CdS traditions. Most of the tracks open with a haunting, echoing voiceover in Spanish, French and English, and the delicate strains of a music box, although it becomes too repetitive after multiple listens.""Rain One"" is a delicate, fragile flower that opens under a midnight shower, with rain sound effects, snare brushes, and fleeting, breathy vocals (""the silence of the sound, and the colour of the night..."") with an operatic interlude.""Le rêveur"" (""The dreamer"") opens with a haunting Middle Eastern modulating duet (both male and female) that bring to mind the Hearts of Space group Rasa and Indian sacred chants.""Vocea"" is a throwback to the CdS soundtrack to ""Dralion,"" and sounds like it was written for ""Dralion"" countertenor Erik Karol in parts. It is one of the darker sounding songs, very wistful, the language sounding almost Russian, with a chanting choir near the end.""Moon Light"" is a gorgeous slow rolling waltz, with a Middle-Eastern sounding string backing and snare brushes and Indian-influenced modulating vocals mixed with the sound of the Portuguese fado.""Patxivota"" picks up the intro from ""Rain One"" and morphs into a dramatic choir that sounds like the theme from ""Myst: Exile,"" with the ghostly whispers of a child dancing inbetween the sweep of the snare drums and the music box.""El p&eacute;ndulo"" yet again draws on the voiceover (""I walk the earth, I touch the skies, I am the angel in your eyes"") and expands on the gorgeous, Cheb Mami-like musings.""Gitans"" features the fantastic talents of the Roma (Gypsy) musicians Taraf de Haidouks, along with a very Am&eacute;lie-like accordion waltz accompanied by chirping birds.""K&egrave;ro Hir&eacute;yo"" is a duet with marked percussion and an almost African feel.""Lubia Dobarstan"" opens with a flamboyant declaration in Spanish of the tale of a wanderer and Latin rhythm and guitars.""Emballa"" is another African/Brazilian influenced choir piece with a male soloist.""Oscillum"" is a high energy, edgy piece that showcases virtuostic violin solos and mysterious whispered vocals.""Funambul"" is easily the most haunting song on the album. A beautiful female vocalist harmonizes and a mixed choir provides a backdrop, along with the ever-present voiceover and children whispering.""Resolution"" is an absolutely chaotic, delightful blend of Gypsy instruments, a very eccentric, happy little song that really feels like a resolution.Please note that I HAVE NOT seen Varekai: my only experience has been through a number of fan websites and Bravo TV's ""Cirque du Soleil: The Fire Within"" which provides a behind-the-scenes look at some of the talented trapeze artists, dancers and gymnasts in Varekai. Selections from Varekai are played as a soundtrack to the series, so I can't comment on how this Varekai-inspired album compares to the actual music in the show (I would love to hear the Tuvan throat singing done live!). I would love to see a live Varekai album as was done with CdS's Myst&egrave;re, and if enough fans are unhappy with this disc, it is likely that the actual music from the show will be released.I give Varekai five stars based on the creativity of blending various ethnic influences (Gypsy, African, Indian, Brazilian/Latin) with modern effects, stunning vocals, and intriguing soundscapes. Varekai is my favourite CdS soundtrack to date, and I hear new nuances with every listen.",2003-01-24 03:06:17.000,16.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.7595115900039673,0.817474365234375,[],5.0

This one has several outstanding songs and the remaining ones are good listening too.  ""Going Down to Liverpool"" repeates a little too much, but I still like the song.  Manic Monday, Eternal Flame and Hazy Shade of Winter are all excellent.  Walk Like An Egyptian was a big hit and it's on here too of course.  This is a good album and probably a good introduction to the Bangles.

5.0,Elvis Presley's final album release during his lifetime,"Seeing Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS brought me back to this one.  Specifically, the use of Unchained Melody (worth the price of the album by itself) and Elvis' performance of it at the end of the film.  This collection pairs From Elvis Presley Boulevard (1976) and Moody Blue (1977) on one disc.  With the exception of a handful of live in-concert tracks, it all adds up to an album filled with songs of loneliness, lost love, and regret.  Three of the studio cuts rock, all in a different vein:  For the Heart has a country-rock bounce, Moody Blue displays a mild disco feel bubbling beneath its pop-rock melody, Way Down harks back to his Burning Love '70s singles heyday.  The rest is made up largely of tears-in-my-beer balladry.  Both of the discs combined here come from the 1976 Graceland sessions and feature a ton of overdubs and sweetening via Felton Jarvis, Elvis' personal producer.  How you feel about that is strictly up to you.  The sweetening was done with the full knowledge and approval of Elvis, so there you are.  The stripped-down versions found on the Way Down in the Jungle Room double-disc Legacy release sound stronger to my ears.  Regardless, the Moody Blue LP was in the charts the day Elvis passed, and it has always held a special place in my heart.  A full five stars for sticking to it and giving his all to the very end.

The second act is contained in the album &quot;Atylantos,&quot; but Emma Shapplin did not appear on it due to a contract disagreement with Pendragon Records.Carmine Meo is a decadent, sensual album that I would label as trance opera. It is at once operatic and electronic, very beautiful. If you are offended by Satanic references, this may not be the album for you. Track 9 is devoted to Lucifer: (Lucifer, that day, looked so much like you/That the bad winds here/Left for another life).Actually, most of the lyrics are extremely depressing: (For her life filled me with errors/Deprived from peace and hope/Her broken heart is gone to heaven) (You've lost this heart/While chasing after a mirage/You've betrayed this heart/And I can do nothing but hate you) ( shout with no tongue/Silence!/Love destroys me/And my sun has lost its way). Then again, most classical opera has equally depressing moments.But the lyrics are not the most important thing here, it is the divine singing of Emma Shapplin that is. The melodies wrap around her pure, crystalline voice with a divine effect. Her soprano is bell-like and piercing with its beauty. The orchestrations are catchy and appropriate: the ominous clanging of a bell and a Gregorian-like chant open Ira Di Dio, nightmarish Halloween-like howls and groans open A La Frontière du Rêve. At times the beautiful sweep of strings lifts the melody skywards (&quot;Dolce Veneno&quot;).

5.0,The Beach Boys 1972: Still sailing on despite the odds,"An absolutely fabulous package and a more than worthy follow-up to the Feel Flows box-set.  The Jack Rieley / Blondie Chaplin - Ricky Fataar years rank among my favorites in the Beach Boys storied career.  Manager (and sometime lyricist) Rieley had guided the band back to significance with 1971's Surf's Up, a personal favorite, and 1972's Carl and the Passions - ""So Tough"" took the revamp even further.  The Flame's rhythm section, Chaplin and Fataar, not only boosted the soul content, but delivered a pair of solid songwriters to the band.  Originally packaged as a specially priced two-fer with Pet Sounds, the LP suffered in comparison with its beloved 1966 companion.  I'll admit I was baffled by the pairing at first, but over the years I've come around and grown to love ""So Tough.""  Holland (1973) has been a favorite since I first sliced through the shrink wrap on the original LP and has remained so ever since.  The great double-album Beach Boys in Concert (1973) was the final Rieley-Chaplin-Fataar Beach Boys era release (excepting 1975's Good Vibrations - Best of the Beach Boys) and it has stood up extremely well.  The amazing success of Capitol's 1974 Endless Summer two-LP set, released in a wave of sixties nostalgia in the wake of American Graffiti, spelled the end of this creative chapter in the Beach Boys saga.  Their shows shifted to car and surf oldies nights, the Brian is Back campaign resulted in less than stellar efforts like 15 Big Ones, and without the sure and certain hand of Jack Rieley at the helm the band devolved into internal warring factions.  Still, as this glorious collection attests, there were mighty, mighty artistic highs  before the inevitable fall to creative lows.  Six discs of Beach Boys nirvana may well be a bit over the top for casual fans.  For them, I'd suggest sticking to the two-disc distillation of this massive set.  For the hardcore fan, however, this beautifully presented, thoughtfully programmed, and fabulously remixed and remastered set will be the true, lasting treasure of a magnificent time in the history of one of America's greatest bands.

Not saying that's a bad thing as it's a quite listenable and enjoyable album.  In the context of 1977, when it was recorded and released however, it was quite out of place and doomed to commercial failure from the start.

Hunter plays blues harp, guitar, and sings, while guitarist Dot and bassist Tony Hilton round out the crew.Cry Wilf! is basically a cover album with a few original tunes thrown in; the reverse of what Hunter would include on his three solo albums [[ASIN:B000GNOSKY ...Believe What I Say]] (1996), [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]](2001), and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]](2006), including songs by Lee Dorsey (Ya Ya), Barbara Lewis (Hello Stranger), Ike Turner (Get Over It Baby), Walter Jacobs (Boom Boom), and Willie Dixon (Mellow Down Easy). The original songs Got A Thing For You, Same Old Nuthin', Can't Stand It No More and Shake It hold up well compared to the established classics in their fidelity to retro songwriting and instrumentation.Hunter plays a mean blues harp, a talent which I didn't know he possessed based on his later solo work and stints with Van Morrison. His guitar chops are also solid, at times borrowing from established bluesmen, at times straying into Chuck Berry territory and even a touch of surf guitar. Hunter's raspy, soulful voice is perfectly suited to these tales of hard living (and loving), and his band is tight (the only welcome addition would be keyboards/Hammond organ).Hunter is more guttural, more emotional, and less composed than on his solo albums, where he spends more time cultivating a soul blues persona a la Sam Cooke, and I found this grittier, soulful side of James a pleasant departure from his carefully crafted ballads such as Mollena on more recent releases. It's amazing to hear him when he was just starting out on his musical career; not bad for a boy from Colchester, England who grew up in a trailer in an onion field and worked on the railroad before pursuing his passion for retro soul, blues, and R&B full-time. This is some amazing stuff that deserves a listen, particularly if you're a fan of vintage '50s-'60s blues, R&B, and retro soul.",2008-04-06 23:43:10.000,8.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.9845250248908997,0.9734635353088379,[],5.0

5.0,"A zany throwback to swanky jazz, French surf, opera and more","We received the ""Triplets of Belleville"" soundtrack as a late addition to our March in-store play. About thirty seconds after I put the CD into our carousel player, I was dumbfounded: the most discordant, strange noise crackled over our store speakers--a bizarre melody of a refrigerator, vacuum cleaner and bicycle spokes. What *was* this? (I didn't see the film until a couple of days ago, at which point it all made sense).""This"" was the amazing soundtrack to ""Les Triplettes de Belleville,"" a joint French-Québécois animated feature about Madame Souza and her orphaned grandson Champion, who dreams of becoming a bicyclist in the prestigious Tour de France. When Champion is kidnapped by the Mafia and spirited away to Belleville (a synthesis of Paris, New York and Montréal), Madame Souza enlists the help of the Triplets of Belleville, an aging jazz-era vocal group.The film's soundtrack reflects the jazz stylings of Django Reinhart (Belleville Rendez-Vous (there are three versions: French, demo and English (performed by -M-,  and the film was nominated for an Oscar for best song), Jazzy Bach), along with melancholy French café accordion music (Attila Marcel, sung by the amazing Béatrice Bonifassi, and Bruno's Theme), French surf music (Pa Pa Palavas, performed by the film's composer, Benoît Charest), opera (""Cieco Cieco"" Barber), and spy-style chase songs (French Mafia Theme, The Shadowing, The Chase).I would have enjoyed the soundtrack more if it had been listed as it appeared in the movie, though. Also, the gorgeous ""Kyrie Eleison"" from Mozart's Mass in C Minor was left off. But the nineteen tracks (and one hidden track) are a wonderful mixture of old and new, jazz and Parisian café, delightfully quirky and guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

I love music from the 30's, 40's and 50's and it just seems there are better collections out there. Maybe this is just not the best selection of 40's songs.  Also in some cases, I am thinking that maybe the artist who had the most success with a given song or is best remembered for a song is not necessarily the one performing the song on this album.  For example, I don't remember Doris Day ever singing ""Again"" and ""Dear Hearts & Gentle People"" is (for me) a Bing Crosby Song.  No Bing Crosby at all on this album and he was certainly one of the top 1940's performers.  The collection does indeed include top artists of the era and it's a good sampler; it just doesn't seem as interesting as it could have been.

4.0,Opera with a twist...,"Lately I have found myself wholly addicted to classical crossover, with a slew of talented artists to choose from: Izzy, Summer, Mario Frangoulis, Josh Groban, and Sarah Brightman, to name a few. I first heard of the Opera Babes when I was browsing at a record store and bought their CD because it contained some of my favourite arias: Un Bel Di from Madame Butterfly, the Flower Duet from Lakm&eacute;, and Ebben from La Wally, and although I had some initial reservations, I was not disappointed.Classically trained soprano Rebecca Knight and mezzo soprano Karen England began their OperaBabes career by busking opera to passerby in Covent Garden in 2001. Discovered by the management of crossover phenom Russell Watson, the Babes soon found themselves singing at football finals and basking in stardom.""Beyond Imagination"" blends classical with world, dance, and new age, most times with excellent and imaginative results. I have to give the CD an A for effort and creativity. Instrumentals such as the Arabian Dance from the Nutcracker ballet and Largo from Dvorak's New World Symphony shine as duets, as does You Live On In My Heart's treatment of Morricone's Cinema Paradiso theme. One Fine Day is opened with a gorgeous Eastern-inspired blend of gong, bamboo flute, and wood blocks. ""O Fortuna's"" foreboding Latin lyrics and ominous choir seem strangely muted by comparison until the final third of the song, but erupts in a passionate finale. The Flower Duet is a soothing blend of new age: raindrop like percussion and flowing harp underscore the melody. Ode II Joy, taken from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, is a study in less is more: with utter simplicity (a simple string backing), the song is uplifting without being overpowering.The bonus tracks did less for me: The Vibe Tribe remix of Lakm&eacute; H20 is too techno for my tastes and adds nothing over the album version. Ave Maria starts out pastorally but ends up overly melodramatic by the end (although still pleasant). Vittoria from Aida sounds like it came off ""Generic Car Commercial Background Music Vol. 1"" (which can be said of a few songs off Beyond Imagination).Overall, Beyond Imagination is a pleasant listening experience, beautifully touching up old favourites with new arrangements, blending in new lyrics, and breathing instrumental classics to life. It's wonderfully relaxing and perfect for long car trips, reading or daydreaming. Fans of Sarah Brightman, Izzy and Charlotte Church should check out Opera Babes.",2003-11-20 15:37:32.000,8.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.6297506093978882,0.9450696110725403,[],4.0

4.0,A mysterious journey through space and styles,"Strangely enough, I'd actually picked up the &quot;Red Planet&quot; soundtrack years before renting the movie (after seeing the movie, I still prefer the soundtrack as a standalone). The reason for buying a soundtrack to a movie I'd never seen can be summed up in two words: Emma Shapplin (n&eacute;e Cryst&egrave;le Joliton).Ms. Shapplin is a French chanteuse who specializes in Gothic operas with Renaissance Italian lyrics (buy her fantastic debut &quot;Carmine Meo&quot; to experience her for yourself). On &quot;Red Planet&quot; she lends her angelic soprano to three tracks: &quot;Inferno,&quot; &quot;The Fifth Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Canto XXX,&quot; all cleverly taken from Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot; (another song on the soundtrack, &quot;Dante's Eternal Flame,&quot; pays tribute to the author as well). These three songs are the high point of &quot;Red Planet&quot; and the reason I gave the soundtrack four stars (I did not care for the Peter Gabriel song and remix). Emma's songs are not present in the film, instead orchestral versions are used (some of which, sadly, are not included on the soundtrack).The other songs are an eclectic mix from Sting (&quot;A Thousand Years&quot; from &quot;Brand New Day&quot;), Peter Gabriel (&quot;The Tower That Ate People&quot; and remix), Strange Cargo's &quot;Montok Point,&quot; Melissa Kaplan (&quot;Dante's Eternal Flame&quot;), and Graeme Revell's score (&quot;Mars Red Planet,&quot; &quot;Alone,&quot; and &quot;Crash Landing,&quot; which doesn't really seem to fit with the musical mood). Revell uses lush layering of synths, and space-type sounds (fragile bells/windchimes on ""Inferno,"" layered choirs and mysterious background noises on ""Canto XXX,"" the world beat choirs on ""Alone"" and ""Fifth Heaven,"" delicate piano, lush strings) to create a mysterious, occasionally tense soundscape. ""Crash Landing"" resorts to an atonal cacophony of sound that was most unpleasant to my ears, but the rest of Revell's score compliments the film's tense, mysterious atmosphere perfectly.My two main complaints with the soundtrack are length (with a noticeable lack of onscreen score and only twelve songs, two being remixes) and sequencing. Overall, &quot;Red Planet&quot; is a unique listening experience that fans of electronic/Emma Shapplin should enjoy and a nice accompaniment to the film.",2003-08-31 22:57:52.000,8.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.8798788785934448,0.8766177892684937,"['cuts', 'Makes']",5.0

5.0,It Doesn't Get Any Better,"There are not very many truly 5-star albums out there, but this is one.  Johnny has a clean, clear voice and is just so easy to listen to.  The pairing with Janie Frike on several duets is one of the best pairings in country music.  (I am a bit biased because I love Janie Fricke.)  It's surprising that Johnny did not make it much bigger for a longer time, but I think many times it's about having good songs.  There are some really good songs here and they were Johnny's biggest hits.  Other songs just didn't make it as big and maybe Johnny just wasn't able to churn out as many hits as quickly as other better known singers or maybe his stuff didn't get the airtime that others did.  Who knows? In any case, I would grab this album.  It's even a good first intro to Johnny Duncan.  A wonderful album that you won't regret owning.

But they were never considered hip or happening within the rock press, not ever.

They're all smokin' and they're all included here, along with their last and biggest hit, Indian Reservation.  Their recordings were used to great effect recently in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.  Maybe that caught your attention and made you Raiders curious.  Whatever.

The original release date was 1991 and this album has since been  reissued as &quot;Film Cuts,&quot; which is still in print in the United  States. However, Reel Music boasts additional tracks from the films  &quot;Three Wishes for Jamie,&quot; &quot;Tristan and Isolde,&quot; and  &quot;The Year of the French&quot; that were deleted from the reissue. In  all, this is an excellent sampler of various musical styles and traditional  Irish instruments such as the Irish harp, tin whistle, bodhrán, uilleann  pipes (Irish bagpipes), and the tiompán. The music ranges from wistful to  suspenseful to exuberant. If you like this CD, I would also recommend  &quot;The Ballad of the Irish Horse,&quot; which is a Chieftains score to a  National Geographic documentary of the same name.

That's good, as each album and each review should stand on it's own.  Fiona has an incredible voice, powerful, but not overpowering.  Some describe it as ""smoky"".  Instead, I would say rich and unique.  Perhaps a little dreamy at times too.  I can't say I am thrilled with any of the songs here, but I did like the title song, which is a little different than anything I've heard before and quite different than the other songs on the album too.  The music doesn't drown out Fiona's voice, so you can tell what she is singing; it's very well-produced.  One fault I find with many modern albums is that the music just overwhelms the artist.  That's not the case here. After listening, I can't say that I hunger for more of Apple's songs, but it will be interesting to see what she comes up with next.

5.0,You'll listen to this Night and Day!,"Sinatra Sings Cole Porter collects Frankie's Porter recordings from his 1943-1952 era, including a large number of previously unreleased radio and TV broadcasts. All of Porter's signature songs are here, including Night and Day, I Get A Kick Out Of You, Don't Fence Me In, Cherry Pies Ought To Be You, and Begin the Beguine.The earliest songs are from 1944 (Begin the Beguine, I Get A Kick Out Of You, Easy To Love / I've Got You Under My Skin, Begin the Beguine), and the latest from '50, so there's a fairly narrow range here. Arrangements are by the consistent, constant Columbia-era collaborator Axel Stordahl.Sinatra's not breaking any new stylistic ground from his Columbia roots, but the many broadcast recordings capture a live playfulness, such as the sassy tit-for-tat exchange with Rosemary Clooney on Cherry Pies Ought To Be You or the exasperated ""Too many words!"" ad-lib on Don't Fence Me In. Sinatra allows himself more breathing room on the live tracks, and even the band sounds like they're having fun. That's important, since that element of playful spontaneity is largely lost on studio recordings. On Why Can't You Behave, the jazz backing verges on blues, and Sinatra's delivery is molasses-slow but loaded full of sultry, wistful longing.The perfunctory liner notes by Sinatra historian Will Friedwald lack the usual in-depth tidbits of his Sinatra notes. There are several vintage photos that, again, seemed to sparkle less than usual. Finally, there is a tracklisting with original recording / release dates, and sources.As these are live recordings, there are the predictable infatuated screams from the bobby-sox crowd, which are distracting, but not a fatal flaw. Due to the rarity and age of some of the source material (lacquer discs and tapes, glass, aluminum and vinyl transcription discs, and film elements), tracks 6, 11, 12 and 18 contain audible flaws that were not able to be fully restored, but as a historical record, they're priceless.Verdict: Sinatra Sings Cole Porter is a must have for both fans of early Frank Sinatra and for fans of Porter and the Great American Songbook. Sinatra was at his finest when recording Porter under Columbia, and these many rare, previously unreleased performances are a testament to his versatility, subtle phrasing, and utter understanding of the material.",2008-03-13 23:45:10.000,7.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.9068647027015686,0.9165152311325073,[],5.0

Elvis Is Back (1960), along with From Elvis in Memphis (1969), bookend that decade as his two best post-army albums.  On Elvis Is Back (and singles), he shows off his new voice and takes on material from across the pop scene spectrum.  1961's Something for Everybody (again, plus singles) is a bit less successful, but only because the playlist isn't quite as strong.  His vocals are a wonder to behold throughout -- committed, strong or gentle, always in service of the song.  He's like a method actor of music, bringing the full depth and weight of his life experiences to each performance, especially the ballads.

5.0,The most amazing (Italian) tenor I've ever heard,"I'd seen ""Alessandro Safina"" in record stores several times, and finally picked up a copy out of curiosity. I'd never heard of Alessandro before, but now I realize what I've been missing out on! Safina (from Siena, Italy) has a fantastically powerful, sensual tenor voice that puts many contemporary classical crossover tenors (Andrea Bocelli, Russell Watson, Josh Groban) to shame.Safina's voice is in a league of its own. The opening track ""Music of the Night"" features a Latin guitar, choir, and a percussion-enhanced finale that breathe new life into an old favourite. On ""Music of the Night"" Safina's voice becomes a gentle, crooning plea--I was nearly left in tears, for Safina clearly outshone all the performances of ""Phantom"" I'd ever seen in Toronto (five) *and* all of the cast recordings. If they ever make that ""Phantom of the Opera"" movie based on Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, they should cast Alessandro Safina instead of Antonio Banderas--he's beautiful (he's been dubbed ""the singing George Clooney"" for his resemblance to a certain American actor) and he has the voice of an angel!His voice can be darkly sensual, rough velvet, evident on ""Luna (Only You),"" an amazing piece that opens with a sultry jazz (female) solo that dissolves into Safina's commanding tenor. It is the most electronic/dancelike of the fourteen songs on ""Safina,"" with a pronounced drumbeat. Gorgeous background piano accompaniment and sweeping strings cradle Safina's voice without overpowering. A background choir chants near the end of the song, which blends Safina's and the female soloist's voice along with piano notes that trail off into silence.""La Sete di Vivere"" is a slower, gentler song, again accompanied by piano, strings and synth. ""Aria e memoria"" begins with a melancholy wavelike rhythm, building into a gently affirmative chorus. ""Siena"" is an ode to his hometown, sung in the softest of seductive whispers that becomes a full-voiced declaration. ""Il Mirto E la Rosa"" opens with a sultry flamenco guitar solo that shimmers in the moonlight, until the piano softly creeps in and the sonic tension builds with the addition of a synth backbeat, until the chorus erupts into a passionate whirl of sounds and colour.""'Stu Bbene"" is tinged with flamenco flavour and awash in gentle strings and piano. Safina sings as if his voice is a fragile glass bauble here, so delicately until he reaches the chorus that we are once again surprised and thrilled when he unleashes the full power of his tenor voice. That is his general attack mode with most of the songs here, and it works. Soft, crooned intros melt into full voice, sometimes taking us by (breathless) surprise.The two instrumental ""Ehyeh"" and ""Diva Mea"" are very interesting additions. ""Ehyeh"" is actually the background instrumentals to ""Il Mirto E La Rosa"" and ""Diva Mea"" is the backing track to ""Luna"" complete with female vocalist and choir. Very uplifting tracks that sound like film music and are beautiful even without the vocals, ""Ehyeh"" in particular as the flamenco guitar really shines as a solo. Finally ""Aria e Memoria--We'll Be Together"" is a duet with Chrissie Hynde. It is the same song as ""Aria E Memoria"" from earlier in the album, this time as an English-Italian duet with Chrissie's voice in the foreground. Very powerful and effective.Alessandro has also released a Spanish version of this album, ""Junto a ti"" and performed backing vocals on a song from the ""Moulin Rouge"" soundtrack, ""Your Song"" with Ewan McGregor. Try to catch his PBS Great Performances special that was filmed on location in Italy, ""Alessandro Safina in Concert: Only You."" As far as I know it is not available on video or DVD.

3.0,A decent overview of SeaQuest's first-season score,"The short-lived sci-fi series SeaQuest DSV went through a number of rotating composers in its three-year tenure, but John Debney (scorer of television, theme park, and motion picture soundtracks such as [[ASIN:B000008123 Cutthroat Island]] and [[ASIN:B00006359N The Scorpion King]]) created the show's Emmy-winning theme song and the pilot score. Other regular contributors included Don Davis and Russ Landau.The SeaQuest soundtrack features original score from three first-season episodes: the pilot To Be or Not To Be, Knights of Shadows, and Such Great Patience. It opens with the dashing, proud Main Title, also known as the SeaQuest theme. Full of bright trumpets and sweeping scales on strings, it sets the theme amply for a show focused on Earth's last frontier: deep sea exploration and colonization.The majority of the other tracks are on-screen action cues full of tension-filled snare strikes, cymbals, and threatening brass underscoring onscreen battles. The main theme weaves in and out of the various tracks throughout the CD, such as morphing into a soft, dream-like lullaby on Bridger's Dream. In Darwin Speaks, a flute carries the SeaQuest theme as a haunting panpipe represents Darwin's first attempts at computerized communication (throughout early episodes, Darwin's cues would make use of panpipes).To be quite honest, I bought this as a die-hard fan, and it's most likely only to appeal to die-hard fans, since all the tracks sound the same (e.g., the SeaQuest theme is reprised on each), but it's a nice souvenir of the show's first (and in my opinion, the best) season of SeaQuest DSV that sonically captures some of the onscreen highlights. Debney does a more than capable job of bringing excitement and wonder to Earth's last unexplored frontiers: the oceans.",2008-03-14 01:48:53.000,1.0,False,CDs_and_Vinyl,en,positive,0.47410428524017334,0.908333420753479,[],5.0

Fabric blend isn’t listed and it needs to be for the buyer. This is thin poly/cotton synthetic mix and in certain lights its see-thru.. mine wears with undershirt as a base layer bc of it! Material isnt the softest and this doesn’t appear to be made with latest moisture wicking and stretch found in many others. It’s not as if everything's all wrong with shirt..its just hard to find a lot of things right- if that makes sense..?!Washing: I chose cold to preserve bright color and line dried to avoid shrinkage..

Honestly, if you're a women of curves - as I am, I would NOT recommend this even in the 2x - it's just too small.  It's disappointing that the sizing is so off.

5.0,So Soft and Very Well Made Scarf,"[[VIDEOID:d2988928d234f06a0c891dc9df76e75]] I am usually very hesitant to buy clothes for my wife because I will either get the size wrong, the color wrong, the style wrong or some combination of those three. A scarf is a safe bet, though, so I selected this scarf with the intention of giving it to her as a surprise. It is a nicer scarf than I expected.This is a cashmere-blend scarf that is made of some of the softest material I have ever felt in an article of clothing, even softer than a fleece blanket which should say a lot. It has a texture similar to wool but without the scratchiness and without the distinct smell that comes with wool (I like that smell but it's very unique). The tassels are all about 3” long and are all along the short edge.Unfolded and stretched out this scarf is a little over 2' wide and is about 7' long.In addition to being so soft, it's well made too. I have found no blemishes in the material and no nits, pills or cuts. The stitching is tight and straight.This is not an expensive scarf but is far and away better than I hoped. It is exceptionally soft and very nicely made. For once I just might make some points with my wife for picking out clothing for her.Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.,"Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",2006-01-23 01:34:33.000,25.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.8335714340209961,0.7270960807800293,['recommend'],5.0

4.0,Enticing Photos and Great Articles,"Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.",2006-07-24 19:59:29.000,41.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.6911391019821167,0.9794849753379822,[],5.0

4.0,Living and Thriving in a House Made With Logs,"Log Home Living is a good magazine for those who have an active interest in buying and living in a home made from logs. This publication covers everything you need to know about this type of living, from the planning of a home all the way through the financing, the furnishing, and the maintenance.What I enjoy most about this magazine is the fine photographs found on most every page. I don't really have much interest in living in this type of home, but the photos are very appealing and enticing. Some of them are taken inside of log homes, letting you see firsthand the dividends that some attention to design can bring. Some of them are taken on the exterior, allowing readers to see the country landscape and marvel in the natural beauty.Another nice feature of this magazine is the abundance of phone numbers and web sites for goods and services. If you find something you like, you will know exactly where to turn for more information. If you find a product or service you like that doesn't list a source, don't worry- there are some special index sections in the back with lists of products from the current issue, referenced by page number, showing the company name, phone, and web site so you can find what you like and make a purchase.On the negative side, a magazine like this one contains LOTS of advertisements. The majority of them are found at the end of the magazine, but there are plenty of them throughout and you cannot turn more than a few pages before finding one. I would estimate that more than two- thirds of the pages have some sort of advertisement.Since a good deal of this magazine is dedicated to furnishing, interior design, landscaping, and maintenance, there is something here to suit every home owner's needs. Even if you don't have an interest in log homes, you can still find plenty to enjoy in Log Home Living.

I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.During a cross country moving event 7 years ago, I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology, not a telemarketer for sure, called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later.

4.0,"informative, interesting, good layperson level","NewScientist is a lot of fun to read and keeps you up to date with some of the newest science being done. It's a nice laypersons' coverage. It doesn't approach Scientific American in its depth, complexity, or ""sciency"" language, but it's popularized rather than dumbed down. The writing is always clear and concise.  I'd say it probably is not as simplified or ""newsy"" as Discover (which I also read and enjoy), putting it in a nice middle category of science for laypeople magazines.  It comes weekly, which I really appreciate.It has a ""this week"" section which covers a few topics in short fashion (1/2 to 1 page articles), then an ""In Brief"" section which covers more topics, um, in brief (usually 1/4 page articles).  There are a few pages of brief Technology articles (1/3rd to 1 page articles), a science-based editorial, an interview or two, and then several longer, in-depth articles, including the cover article. These are usually 3 or 4 pages with the cover article 4-6 pages.  Recent cover topics  have been the Higgs, Memory, Neutrinos.  The magazine closes with some book reviews, a feedback section, and a question-to-the editors section.  I write and I find myself often clipping out articles of interest or of use.

4.0,The Many Challenges of Business Ownership,"Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.",2005-10-01 14:57:26.000,10.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.7543759942054749,0.9823266863822937,[],5.0

3.0,"Enjoy a Fantasy, with Yachting Magazine","Yachting Magazine is a publication dedicated to the acquisition of large sea going vessels and the enjoyment that spending time on a yacht can bring. This publication is all about big boats, with an emphasis that is divided between buying a yacht, comparing yacht performance, evaluating new models of yachts, and enjoying life to the fullest as the owner/operator of your own home on the water.Yachting Magazine is a magazine about luxury and it compares favorably to other, similar publications. Magazines about yachts are intended for an elite group of people for whom money is no object and Yachting Magazine is no different. The big boats talked about, tested, and offered for sale in the classified section usually sell for a minimum price of around half a million dollars and many of them sell for multiple millions of dollars, placing the bulk of the magazine's promoted material out of the reach of most individuals.Even though yachting magazine is impractical for most people, there are a few nice features with Yachting Magazine and at the top of the list is the photography. Not only do you get to gaze in awe at these incredible aquatic machines, you also get to enjoy great photographs of beautiful lakes, oceans, and rivers where yachts of different sizes can often be found. These photographs set the imagination soaring and they rank as the magazine's number one asset. Second to the photographs are the travel articles. Again, they usually feature some nice photography, not to mention a few travel secrets from coastal and/or riverfront cities around the world.As for the writing in Yachting Magazine, it is generally good, but other than the articles mentioned above, most of the material in this publication is too simplistic and/or irrelevant to the bulk of the population. For example, the evaluations of new make/model of yachts are often very lacking, offering only a one page summary, which isn't nearly enough to make an informed buying decision. Worse from a practical standpoint, the vessels the magazine features are usually in the one million+ dollar price range. This is fantasy material for most people. The yachts are nice to look at and fantasize about, but unless I receive a pay raise in the one- thousand percent range, there is practically no chance that I will be purchasing a multi- million dollar yacht any time soon.Taken as a whole, Yachting Magazine is an acceptable publication that I will continue to read solely for its eye- candy properties. I really like the photography and the magazine can sometimes impress with a few of its travel articles. But other than that, Yachting Magazine is a fantasy read, pure and simple. Even though the photographs are great and they can set your imagination on fire, the magazine is an impractical read for most with more fantasy material than your favorite adult movie.",2009-08-20 19:43:47.000,17.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.7242835164070129,0.9845601320266724,[],5.0

3.0,Family Centered Recipes and a Magazine Loaded with Advertising,"Years ago my mother was one of the original &#34;editors&#34; of Taste of Home.  That said, anyone who wrote a recipe and had it published was considered an editor.This WAS a great magazine for the home cook.  Most of the recipes were kitchen friendly with ingredients and tools you would have in a decently stocked kitchen.  Something along the lines of smoked paprika might have been considered &#34;classy&#34; or even foreign.  Today, with Reader's Digest at the helm, it's a different magazine.  Gone are the days of no advertisements (subscriptions paid for the publishing and profit) and it is now filled with big glossy photos of food, kitchen and body related items that the publishers feel you cannot live without.  I, for one, can live without them.Having spend more than 20 years in the culinary business from the bottom of the chain to operator and now educator, I would occasionally use Taste of Home for a &#34;comfort food selection&#34;.  These particular recipes would be given to the newest of the new cooks to prepare and have ready for service.Taste of Home still has decent recipes.  It isn't the friendly magazine that it once was.

3.0,Build Your Dream Aircraft with Kitplanes,"Kitplanes is a different kind of magazine and one that will only appeal to a limited audience. This magazine is intended for those who love airplanes and whose interest in airplanes reaches a level that goes beyond simply flying. Kitplanes takes aviation to a different level for a magazine by focusing on actually building aircraft. Kitplanes is more than just a mechanical read- it is also a creative read that explores the different ways that small aircraft can be built, the different designs, and the different styles and capabilities.Most of the pages in Kitplanes are dedicated to design and construction. From the initial mental blueprint to the proper hardware, Kitplanes wants to help the enthusiastic hobbyist construct the dream machine. Some of the articles in Kitplanes are educational in nature, focusing on the specifics of aerodynamics, the pros and cons of using different types of metals, etc. The magazine even includes some success stories from builders who have completed their aircraft construction and want to share their results with the reader.Mechanics are important, but in the day and age in which we live, technology is more important than ever and Kitplanes is right there to help. Small aircraft isn't as sophisticated as commercial aircraft, but the aircraft building hobbyist still wants to be as safe as possible, and Kitplanes offers plenty of tips on instrument panels, safety systems, and other things high tech in nature.One other interesting aspect of Kitplanes is that it's a very consistent magazine. Each issue I have read contains exactly 80 pages and the departments and most of the regular features are found on exactly the same page number each month. For those who like consistency and repetition, this is a nice feature for a magazine. But this will not sit well with people who like a little variety from time to time. I am one of the types who like some variety in my magazines, so the consistency is a strike against the magazine, even if only a small strike.Kitplanes is, overall, a pretty good magazine about a very expensive hobby. I find the articles pretty good, even though some are certainly better than others. Some are a little too brief and assume the builder needs guidance from start to finish but Kitplanes is still a useful magazine for those who dream about constructing their own airplane. It does have a few shortfalls, but for the flying enthusiast who dreams of constructing his/her own aircraft, Kitplanes is a magazine worth reading.",2008-12-31 18:07:54.000,8.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.950415313243866,0.718279242515564,"['delighted', 'inspirational articles', 'quality', 'magazine', 'interresting']",5.0

4.0,Smart Money Combines Business and Personal Finance,"Smart Money is a solid magazine about business and finance and I have been reading it on and off again for the past five years. This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten.",2007-07-12 09:59:42.000,19.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,negative,0.6889954805374146,0.8063750267028809,[],1.0

5.0,Dreamy Articles about Spas and Cooking,"Well, in the November issue last year, this magazine had a spa getaway section. Now I know why so many people were in La Conner the last time I was there. There is a top-secret spa hiding there. Who knew! I love La Conner and had no idea there was a day spa there.They also featured the ""Salish Lodge and Spa"" at which you might find me drinking tea with my parents on a lazy afternoon or having dinner when I'm feeling like splurging on a gourmet dinner. They have redecorated, however they still have a wonderful fireplace upstairs. I spent the first night of my honeymoon at the Salish Lodge and I can't wait to stay there again. They have deep baths and the entire experience of staying there is just luxurious. Anyway, this magazine tells you where to go and gives you ideas for luxurious getaways now and then. Oh and don't forget Rosario. When my aunt took us away for the weekend, we had our toes painted while sitting out in the sun.If you are thinking of visiting Seattle, this is a good magazine to keep handy so you can find out about treasures like the Elliot Bay Book Company or Pike Place Market. The Dining Guide will lad you to places you only thought appeared in dreams. If you are in Seattle, go to Palisade. There is an amazing view, gourmet food to die for and even a fish pond with a cute bridge you can walk over. We love this place for family parties. Ray's boathouse has an upstairs café we love and then there is the Metropolitan Grill where you will taste steaks that have been grilled over mesquite coals. If you want to go all out and enjoy a nine-course feast, try The HerbFarm that is now located in Woodinville. Chef Jerry Traunfeld also makes amazing Lavender cookies and the recipe is in his HerbFarm cookbook.This magazine inspires thoughts of staying at the Edgewater hotel and watching ferries sail by on lazy rainy days. You will always find intriguing features, talk about the town and a section on enjoying the good life of food and entertainment.~The Rebecca Review",2004-01-29 07:45:34.000,8.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.8981773257255554,0.9865438342094421,"['March', 'friend', 'bought', 'Finally', 'pick', 'received']",5.0

4.0,Technology and Public Policy,"Technology magazines are often a little bit on the boring side due to their limited appeal that makes them readable only to those who work in or have an avid interest in this field. IEEE Spectrum, however, is a little bit different. It has plenty of information on the latest advancements in technology, like other tech publications, but from a different ""spectrum"", if you will.What sets this magazine apart from the rest is the personal and political topics that make their way into each issue. You can read about topics like global warming, tariffs, technology regulations, and general business ethics. These different topics are blended together with the magazine's core subject of technology and the result is a publication that is more readable than most in the tech field.Another nice thing about Spectrum is the minimal amount of advertising. What few ads you will see are entirely related in some way to technology. You won't see an ad for a car, boat, home financing, or other product or service like you do in most every other magazine in America. This magazine sticks with technology for its ads and because of this, the few ads that exist seem even less common than they already are.This magazine is a little shorter than other monthly publications, with each issue containing about 50 to 80 pages. This is the length I expect in a weekly magazine- not a monthly one. The publishers need to improve and expand the number of pages. A magazine this short doesn't provide enough reading material for an entire month.Still, IEEE Spectrum is a good technology magazine. The combination of political, economic, and social topics keeps this publication from getting too dry and too technical. It makes it much easier to read than other magazines of the same genre.",2004-12-23 17:51:54.000,9.0,False,Magazine_Subscriptions,en,positive,0.7355694770812988,0.7793639898300171,[],5.0

1.0,New format is terrible,"I used to really enjoy IMDb TV/Freevee before the format got changed.  I used to be able to search and add shows & movies to my list to watch later. Now there's no more my list, and you're only able to go into a show that's already started or wait for it to start in it's pre-assigned time slot. You can still watch a movie from the beginning if you choose it through the Amazon Prime app, not as easy if you try directly from the Freevee app. The search feature is so not user friendly. You only have a very limited choice of genre's to choose from. I guess someone decided that different genre's should just be lumped together, and let the customer figure it out on their own.  Of course since there's no more my list you cannot mark a show/movie to watch later. I thought that the new format was meant to enhance the user's experience, not hinder it. All it succeeded in doing is making me steer away from the app altogether, it's just way too frustrating. If the format stays the same I will be looking at other streaming apps, and will more than likely be cancelling my Prime membership since I'm not even able enjoy the programming. Not happy with the re-formatting of Amazon Prime video either. Where did you find the group of geniuses that came up with these new formats anyway? They obviously don't watch the programming, otherwise they wouldn't have done such a poor job trying to revamp both formats to wind up making them such disappointments to the end user.",2022-09-12 00:07:17.233,2.0,False,Software,en,positive,0.9480398297309875,0.9267565011978149,[],5.0

4.0,A Good Alternative or Supplement to Duolingo or Rosetta Stone,"I have been trying to learn Spanish with a couple high school years from 30 some years ago, Duolingo, and by reading a number of Spanish language books like Harry Potter, The Lion The Witch and the wardrobe.  When I got a chance to get a reviewer subscription to Babbel.com I jumped at it.Initially, I kind of didn't like Babbel.  It seemed a little clumsy.  You need to do a lot of typing, which doesn't work well on my iPhone and was somewhat frustrating on my ipad as the window jumped around when the keyboard came up.  But when I pulled it up on my touch screen laptop, it really worked fairly well.  And, once I got over the ""inconvenience"" of having to type in Spanish words (something Duolingo seems to have limited,) I found that it really helped me to focus on gender and spellings.  It actually became a very good teaching tool, although it took a little familiarity.  You are prompted with lettered buttons that show the letters in the word, which seems like a little too much for a cue.I really liked a number of things that helped my learning.  First, it features a different word set than duolingo, even for the same objects.  I like that I got a different vocabulary.  I also liked that they would put the beginner words into sentences that were unapologetically complex.  It was nice to have more challenging sentences than could be made with the beginner words and when I sampled intermediate and advanced levels, I found that Advanced is an immersion experience that I really like.  Lastly, I think that Babbel does a better job of giving helpful rules for Spanish.  They are brief but seem to stick.The bad things I found was that it gets a little repetitive and grows a little tiring. One of the beginner features is speech recognition which is not working well for me.  Duolingo speech recognition seems a little more tolerant.  With Babbel I find there are some words and phrases it will just not recognize, but this actually focuses me on pronunciation, so this might be good, if a little frustrating.  Definitely use a headset as built in microphones definitely don't work as well.All in all, a good resource with its pros and cons.  It might be in line with duolingo which has the advantage of being free.  But this is a fantastic supplement to Duolingo, and a combination and going back and forth might keep things fresh.",2019-01-15 05:07:59.847,1.0,False,Software,en,positive,0.8496677279472351,0.9961310625076294,[],5.0

4.0,Solid Contender,"I am a recent convert to McAfee's internet security solution and I have recently upgraded from the 2008 version to the 2009 version. I was impressed with the VAST inprovements McAfee has made to their product line to the point that I have found myself recommending their products to people looking for a reasonable solution. With the move to 2009 I was anxious to see what other improvements McAfee has made. There are some updates and improvements, but these seem to be minor.I have two computers, one of which runs Vista Home Premium and the other runs XP Home. Both were running the 2008 version. On the XP box, the installation was smooth and seamless, and after a reboot all was well. The Vista machine had some issues, though, during the installation of each component, where it would complain about a file that either had an invalid path or that could not be overwritten. I was offered a Retry/Cancel dialog box, and in every case the Retry button worked, but having to click over and over again during installation was annoying. I am assuming it was because it was an upgrade, not a fresh install, though both machines were upgrades. After the Vista install was complete, there were no more headaches.I was pleased to see that my settings for the 2008 version were retained for the 2009 version.I noticed something unpleasant between the systems that grabbed my attention, but only because I was looking for differences. The memory usage on the Vista computer is MUCH lower than that on the XP system, for reasons unknown. That said, the performance does not seem to be appreciably different.On the same note, I have noticed that with the 2009 version installed the XP system ran faster than it did with the 2008 version loaded. The Vista machine's performance seems to be unchanged.Next I will discuss the firewall, as that seems to be where the majority of noticeable changes have occurred. With the 2008 version, there were several settings for the firewall that could be made with the adjustment of a slider control. These level settings ranged between Off, Trusting, Standard, Tight, Stealth, and Lockdown (or some minor variation there of - I did not write these down before I upgraded). With the 2009 version, these have been replaced with just three slider settings - Automatic, Standard and Stealth. Lockdown is in a different area. The reduced number of options is not necessarily a bad thing, and I suspect it now matches the actual usage patterns that are prevalent in the software's usage. I always set mine to Stealth and saw no reason to change. When I tested the firewall for security, I was unable to locate a test that caused the firewall to fail, and I was pleased that the firewall prevented my computer from responding to any kind of probe or echo requests.I discovered a curiosity in the firewall's application filters. The filters allow you to set up access rules for any and all applications on your system which is very handy when you have a useful application that you want to keep from accessing the network (such as Acrobat Reader, in my case). After the upgrade several applications in the rule sets that were still loaded on my system were listed as no longer installed. I am not sure what happened there, and I deleted these errant rules. I believe these were probably cosmetic issues, but regardless it was something that drew my attention.The antivirus seems to be virtually unchanged between the 2008 and 2009 versions. The antivirus is very thorough and stable, doing an excellent job of scanning the system. I discovered a check box in the AV settings, that allows you to specify minimal resource usage during a scan. The information help that comes with it states very clearly that AV scanning is a low-priority background task when this option is taken, and it seems to work very much as advertised. With this option checked, McAfee's AV is absolutely the slowest AV I have ever used (600,000 files in 3.5 hours), but it also is so gentle on system resources that it does not impact anything and you might not know it's running except for the animated scanning icon in the system tray.The parental controls in McAfee's suite are, in my opinion, nearly useless. If you want to block anything, you have to specify that you want it blocked, so there is no pregenerated list of URLs. Keyword filtering is a more useful aspect of the filter system, yet it still requires some manual entry.I like the site advisor, which provides some clues as to the safety of the web sites you visit. It does not prevent you from going there, but it does tell you when you have found a potentially harmful site. That says that McAfee is tracking some kind of URL set, yet it does not make the set available to the parental control component which is unfortunate.The antispam component does a fair job of catagorizing email, though I elected to turn it off because I use a different antispam product. With the standard settings, I find that determination of spam is a little trigger-happy but not unreasonable.I played with the ""Manage Network"" component and like the mapping of the network topology. Though it is not something I personally need, it is undoubtedly useful to system administrators who need to see the lay of the land at a quick glance.With McAfee Internet Security installed on both machines, I have seen no appreciable issues and my systems are well protected. I like the firewall configuration and I really like the fact that the antivirus is so gentle on the system when scanning. The other components in the system - with the exception of the parental controls - are sufficient protection for home and SOHO users, though not all are features I use. I am comfortable recommending this package based on my positive experience with it - it is a fine solution for anyone wishing to protect their system without bringing it to its knees.",2008-09-29 02:33:26.000,14.0,False,Software,en,positive,0.7139660716056824,0.7845239639282227,[],4.0

4.0,Unparalled Protection,"I have used Panda Antivirus for many years and I can't recall ever getting a virus or at least none that caused any damage.  Once in a while I will check my system with another scanner just to see if Panda is preventing viruses and it appears to be doing an excellent job.  Rarely do I ever find any viruses that are able to slip by Panda.  You won't find a better antivirus prevention program.  It also does a good job on automatic updates.  It's non-intrusive and runs quietly in the background.  The additional protection of the firewall is a plus and the firewall seems to work well too.  Generally I don't like bundled packages, but this combination seems to work flawlessly.  The firewall doesn't have much configurability, so if that's important to you, you might want to just get the antivirus product instead of the combo, but you can turn off the firewall if you want.  The real downside to Panda is that sometimes the install can be a nightmare.  I don't recall having much of an issue with the 2007 version, but some earlier versions were just horrendous.  If you can deal with a sometimes quirky install and finally get it working, the payoff is well worth the struggle.  Some of the easier to install, better known competitors just don't provide as much protection.  Something else to be aware of is that Webroot SpySweeper (a popular anti-spyware program) had some serious conflicts with Panda's scan.  This is not the fault of Panda and Webroot has corrected most of the conflicts in their current version.  There still appears to be one big conflict, but there is a workaround for it.  Panda's support can be a little spotty at times.  Sometimes I have gotten good response; other times it has been a bit slow.  They always seem to respond even if it takes a while.  Since the product works so well once up and running it is rare that you would even need support; most likely you'll need it an install time.  If you are building a new system, install it early and you shouldn't have any issues.  As security products tend to get more comprehensive, there are a bound to be more conflicts and if you try to run multiple products you can have difficulty.  Panda seems no worse (and no better) than any others in that regard.  I highly recommend it even with the caveats mentioned here.",2006-12-05 17:04:17.000,5.0,False,Software,en,positive,0.9480398297309875,0.9267565011978149,[],5.0

5.0,Simple to use but exceptionally powerful,"Drawing and sketching programs seem to fall into two general categories - very powerful but excessively complex, or simple to use but lacking in options and power. SketchBook Pro successfully combines power and simplicity into one package, such that even a weak artist can be productive and successful.I ran into a problem when installing the application - the installer crashed, giving some odd internal error and number. I tried again immediately and the second try went without a hitch. I assume it is a configuration issue with my system as I have occasional strange issues when installing software.When first launched, the application asks if you have your serial number and key handy. If you are new to SketchBook Pro, I encourage you NOT to enter them just yet but instead specify that you want a 15-day trial. The reason is that you get presented a quick pictoral tour of the feature set when you run in trial mode (which is really just a time-limited demo mode with everything enabled), which is a nice introduction. Afterward, registration information can be entered through the help menu.Being new to SketchBook Pro myself, I was startled by the sparse interface when opening a new canvas. There was little on the screen other than the main menu up top and the lagoon in the lower left. Most drawing applications clutter the screen with an assortment of toolbars, palettes, wizards and other things that just get in the way. Autodesk keep their application simple instead, putting the essentials out there and leaving everything else off the screen until it's really needed.Most elements of the application are available in radial menus, accessible either through clicking on icons on the lagoon or right-clicking on the canvas. All menu items have help tips to guide along the way so you know what option you're choosing. Radial menus can be a surprise to those who have never been exposed to them, but once used to them they are very powerful and easy to use.Plunging into the various options available, I immediately discovered a couple of things I have never before used in drawing applications. First, I discovered the symmetry options, which makes creating mirror images easy. Using the axis, I was able to draw a crude figure of a person in about 10 seconds without even expending any real thought. Even more productive for me, though, was the ruler, especially in combination with the layering tool. The ruler is a slight misnomer, as it is actually more of a straight-edge against which to draw straight lines.Another interesting surprise was the help system. When I launched the help system, rather than bring up a compiled help file, my default web browser launched and I was presented with one of the best help systems I have seen. The help is easy on the eyes and very straightforward to use. There is sufficient detail with pictures to address almost any conceivable question that might arise.SketchBook Pro is very fast and very responsive on my system. I am running Vista with 3GB of ram and a dual-core 2.1G Intel processor, and there is only the slightest hint of hesitation on rare occasion.Having never played with SketchBook Pro before and being a poor artist, I was shocked that I could create viable results in minutes. In the hands of a professional artist, this is a powerful and easy-to-use package. Emphasis was placed on productivity, but power was not taken away.",2009-04-22 03:25:33.000,125.0,False,Software,en,positive,0.7530684471130371,0.9843853116035461,['options'],5.0

It's nice software, I would say probably the best of what is available, but the learning curve could be a detriment to those getting started in genealogy. They have been steadily improving over the last few additions so perhaps in a few years they'll have a version that I like as much as my old Broderbund.

4.0,A good internet security solution,"I upgraded to Panda Internet Security 2007, Platinum Edition (I'll just refer to it as ""Panda"" hereafter), from Trend Micro's PC-Cillin suite after a recurring issue forced me to make a decision. I had had good experiences with Trend and was loathe to change, so changing was not something I really wanted to do. After checking my options and doing some research, I decided to give Panda a chance.Panda's installation was a bit sluggish but it was not unreasonably slow. It did all of the prerequisite checks before configuration and finally it determined that it was ready to install itself. The installation at this point was smooth and straightforward and when it was done it (understandably) asked me to reboot the system.Once the system rebooted, I was off to the races. Panda immediately started to look at programs that were trying to access the network, it flagged me down when I had incoming port scan attacks, and it dutifully logged everything going on. It also did something else - it started giving pop-up bulletins. Within 30 minutes I must have received 3 or 4 pop-up bulletins that contained informational messages, not alerts that demanded attention. While these can be configured to not show up, I was just a little annoyed by the frequency under the default settings. These bulletins have decreased since that time.Panda's first order of business was to eliminate everything it considered to be spyware. This equated to deleting a lot of cookies. Most of these were benevolent, but some were obviously tracking cookies. Panda also seems to be eliminating these types of things when they first reach the system, which in my opinion is a good policy.The firewall does what you would expect a firewall to to - it keeps unwanted traffic out and it prevents programs from reaching the net without your knowledge or approval. A program can be ""locked down"" and denied all access, and through the firewall profile you can make changes and tweaks to access.I did some testing with the antivirus, and it worked relatively quickly to scan the entire system. I was able to tell it to work in the background with reduced CPU requirements and as a result the system did not slow down enough to make it unusable. As of yet it has not found a virus on the system so I just don't know how it will react to one when/if it finds one. My assumption is that I will get another pop-up bulletin.The integrated antispam has yet to prove itself. I use a different antispam product, but Panda still does an evaluation on every inbound message. So far it seems to be properly marking messages as spam or not spam by the footer it places at the bottom of every message, but the other product I use has done the bulk of the work already. I am waiting to see how Panda handles spam messages that slip through the gauntlet and into my inbox. What I have seen thus far suggests that it will probably manage well enough. The antispam does integrate with Outlook automatically and gives a couple of new buttons for classifying spam when it comes.By default, the parental control feature is turned off, and I decided to turn it on. This is one of the features of Panda I don't especially like. It manages access through the parental controls by way of profiles with passwords. So, when you have an internet connection and you have parental controls turned on, Panda requires a password just to get out the net at all. Granted, this is only required one time for the connection, but it is cumbersome and annoying. This type of set-up is not well-suited for family computing but is better for office and academic environments. After testing it for a little while and determining that it seems to work fairly well, I turned it off to avoid getting chastised by my family. I would likely use this more if there was a way to tell it to filter the same way for everyone without requiring a password.Panda queries for updates daily. This is reassuring to me, knowing that I am almost always very current and have the latest signature files. I regard this as mostly psychological though, as I doubt I will ever encounter a virus that is new enough to require this tight of an upgrade schedule. The heuristic scan feature of the antivirus is likely to handle anything like that anyway.One of the more interesting features of Panda is the TruPrevent functionality. Basically, this is a behavioral analysis of applications and processes on the system, which looks for unusual or suspicious activity. So far this has turned up nothing on my system, but it is reassuing to know it's running in the background. This kind of analysis should be used cautiously, though, as there is always a potential for false positives.Visually, Panda is a very simple and straightforward application with a no-nonsense interface. You are not going to be overwhelmed with buttons and sliders and lists and everything else all jumbled on the screen in one big box, but rather everything is kept as simple as possible. Sometimes this means having to dig a little to find the setting you need, but honestly I think the interface is reasonably self-explanatory.The most difficulty I had with Panda was in registering the product. I got a pop-up bulletin that offered a discount if I registered then, and I had already made my mind up to do so, so I followed the offer link. I was taken to a page all in Spanish (this is not entirely unexpected as I believe that Panda is based in Spain). I manageed to reach the English equivalent page, entered the requisite information and the website returned a very short error message. I got through several hours later and got through the registration process, only to find that I was sold the wrong product from the link. To resolve the issue I had to call their office and work it out on the phone.With only a couple of minor annoyances and one registration issue, I have had a very positive experience with Panda. The application is not overly burdensome to my computer, it seems to be very quick and efficient, and it has kept me informed of issues as they arise. I consider this a good solution and I am happy to recommend it.",2007-02-05 17:36:54.000,2.0,False,Software,en,negative,0.6480250358581543,0.8494386672973633,[],1.0

The fragrances are, orange, lavender, frankincense, rosemary, mint, lemongrass, vanilla, seasalt, kiwi, rose, coconut, and papaya.I tried the papaya. When it was first plunged into the water (see video) there was fizz and no suds. Before I could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet, the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later (see photo). Also, the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the package.Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I used this in a foot bath. The water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bath.In summary, these bombs perform terribly, are staining, and are barely fragrant in the bath. The current price of $19.99 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to $1.67 per bath bomb, which is about what I would expect to pay for bombs of this size. However, at that price, I also expect these to perform and they do not. These are super lackluster and an utter disappointment. I am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars.

Blocks out light via not only the outer material but also an internal piece of flannel stitched in. I'm not sure why it has a pocket. Nothing to come out. Perhaps to add your own additional padding or black out material? No idea.Not adjustable, but there is a lot of stretch. How loose or tight this fits depends on your head. I think it would be easy enough to make an adjustment to smaller size with a couple of quick stitches (and I am not one to sew).  I like that it isn't adjustable because usually the adjustable part snags my hair, or I can feel it against my head.However, it being a little large to start is good because I have a large head. My head measures 23.75"", this fits me without feeling too snug. Most feel way too snug. But at some point in night I didnt like the feel. Not sure why yet.Material is nice, stitching is good, comfortable when first on. Over course of night I could feel some pressure. I eventually took it off. I think these will be used for the occasional nap or when I need to just rest my eyes. For me, I think the pressure is due to the use of slim elastic AND the opening to that pocket area. I can just feel it at some point. Most all eye masks use slim elastic and what it does (for me) is create pressure across eye area where it pulls on the material through there. But since this isn't too snug feeling, I think it has more to do with that crease where the pocket it. More material to smash against my face.So initially comfortable but then turns uncomfortable. Your experience may vary.Quality overall seems fine. Love the 3 pack. Love the floral design of the ones I selected. It just isn't quite for me, sadly. I'll try it a few more times.

I often dont have an appetite until half way through my day, but I will feel some low level hunger, and I know I need something to power me through my physical work day. So a simple smoothie usually works (and allows me to add in other supplements such as collagen, mushroom powder).

Thick makes it feel like a shake, and triggers belly into thinking there is something in there.

4.0,2 users/99 readings each; large cuff/display; operation via USB incl /4 AA batteries NOT incl – 3.5*,"This is the 26th BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and it is an decent monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one operates within 5 to 8 points plus or minus from my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 99 readings per user. Note that I did not take 198 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. What is excellent is that the display is color coded. A green backlight means the pressure is normal or low depending on the numbers displayed, an orange/yellow background indicates mild hypertension, and a red background indicates severe hypertension. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings. There is one large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied and that is via the supplied micro-USB cable (an A/C adapter was not included) or via four AA batteries that are NOT included. Time settings are in 12 or 24-hour clock.INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE- One BP unit- One BP User Manual- One User Guide- One large cuff- One micro-USB cable- One thin carry pouchFEATURES- Up to 99 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.- Date and time settings are available.- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading and having the color-coded display is great.- The cuff is 22 to 40 cm (8.66 to 15.748 inches).- The user guide is decent.- Accuracy is good and compares with the BP range taken on my two 5-star gold standard monitors.- Switching user modes is easy by pressing SET (when power is off) and then SET again to switch to the other user.- It displays an average after three readings.- The date and time settings are remembered after power is removed. I tested this for one.NEGATIVES- The reading has a backlight that goes out too quickly. I would have preferred it stayed lit a few more seconds.- The memory delete does not work as specified in the manual. It needs to say that when the display is off, press the MEM button until a BP reading is displayed, then while holding down the button, press the START/STOP for two seconds until the dotted lines appear.This is a decent BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is very simple and was explained well in the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.In summary, this BP monitor displayed numbers within a 5-to-8-point range (+ or -) of my two go to monitors.  Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is super easy but is not as written in the manual. The cuff is large enough for most individuals, although it is about one inch smaller than most large cuffs. The LCD Display is large and the color-coding is good to have but the display lights go out quickly, which is a negative. It displays an AVG after three readings, which is a plus. The current price of $29.99 is reasonable for this monitor.For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried.[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. Unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. I love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.  (5 stars)[[ASIN:B00UB5EXNE A&D Wrist BP Monitor]] – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. (5 stars)[[ASIN:B01AFQK85K HealthSmart Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor. (4 stars)[[ASIN:B07G3P5C1M Choice Basic Upper Arm BP monitor]] –  Super basic.

Unfortunately, the BP is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) mostly due to the unit/cuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.

Accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors and this monitor would have received 4 stars had it not been for the cheap faceplate which falls off repeatedly because it is only taped on.

These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about ten minutes in hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. BUT.....I used the rose bath bomb and the final color of the water was an indigo blue which turned my heels and toenails a SMURF BLUE. I also had a blue ring around my ankle. The skin color dissipated during drying but the nail color stayed for several showers. The blue coloring was easy to rinse off the foot bath.The current price of $32.99 comes to $2.75 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than others I tried previously.

The electrolytes are mostly sodium and potassium, both important for muscle function and many other functions inside the human body.I tend to dilute it more than instructed since it is pretty sweet. The taste is not bad but among the energy boosters I have tried this is not my favorite, it is ok. I have had no negative reactions to this but didn't really feel any energy boosting effects from this at all since they do claim some energy boosting effects calling it an energy blend.All in all this is just ok.

I am sure that I am not the only one who finds that taking on and off the mask is cumbersome. Etiquette says that you don’t let your mask hang from one ear or on your chin, so these lanyards definite alleviate that problem. They allow you to keep your mask around your neck. No need to remove it, shove it in your pocket or wear inappropriately. Not only that but how many times have you found your mask pulling on your ears. These extenders reduce that pull on them.

4.0,"sucralose as sweetener, good flavor, I like adding it to a cup of coffee, low collagen amount","I like it 3.5 to 4 stars. (I like it more than middle of road 3 rating)I keep a selection of instant coffee on hand for at home and on the go. I sometimes add it to smoothies, sometimes I make a quick iced drink (shaken), sometimes I just want a very quick cup of coffee and the taste of instant can be pleasing to me. More often, I add it to a cup of brewed coffee. Get an extra boost (flavor, caffeine)!  And that is primarily how I drink this. I make myself a cup of dark bold coffee, blend a packet of this in, and enjoy. I like the light vanilla taste, and the sweetness level is on point for me. I dont often sweeten my coffee as I prefer it black, but I do enjoy some sweetened coffee with cream on occasion.Prepared as is? The sweetness level is more pronounced, as is the vanilla. Wish ""no sugar added"" products that use sugar alternatives would use less. So made alone is a tad much for me. I like that it is super quick and easy to make, can be made with hot or cold water, and is well packaged. I like the added supplements. The amount of collagen peptides is low (3 grams), where my typical scoop of collagen powder always offers 10+ grams per serving.You decide. It uses SUCRALOSE as its sweetener. I have found it used in ""keto"" products, but I also see many keto products omitting it and using something else. I am not on a strict keto diet, nor any keto diet. I am just reducing my sugar intake, and by doing so I tend to buy things that end up using sucralose. SO FAR, I have not had any issue with weight loss. It is October as I write this, and I have dropped 50 lbs since April, and I haven't tried all that hard. Just dropped sugar laden desserts and have been moving more. Maybe my weight loss would be further along, but I still take down half a pizza every week. But massive calorie reduction from dropping desserts, and using sugar free alternatives.. which happens to include sucralose. I'd like to see less of it used across the board, but in mean time it doesn't seem to be a hinderance to my health and goals.I do not rate on price as we all have different budgets, needs, interests. The price is posted, and not a surprise, so I just focus on my experience and perception of taste, quality, and how it lines up to the product description. THOUGH, I do comment.. and this really is ridiculously priced. I have some good instant coffee products with similar nutrition profile where each pack is in the upper $1 range (and people still freak over price). So for me, this is a bit prohibitive for daily use, but that is just me and my budget.The packaging is cool though. Might make for a nice addition to a food or coffee or keto themed gift basket. Nice looking packets tucked into a tray with a slide on cover. Then it is wrapped in plastic.

5.0,Love everything about Nespresso except pod $..!!,"01/23 update: trying a different brand of lids when I ran out… I came back SO FAST!! Others failed me miserably!!! TBH, I was surprised to see any had issue using these- as these have single-handedly saved my coffee budget. If you take a minute to do the steps- truly, it can work like a charm!Finally- A fix to the costly pod price for Nespresso coffee maker! Not only does the “have to use pod“ cost a pretty penny.. but, they limit the ability to try different options in your coffee maker.. and limit any ability to go green. That’s a lot of control for one tiny appliance to have!! (IMHO!)Most important thing to know- SAVE YOUR OLD NEPRESSO PODS.. you NEED these in order to use these lids!! Every pod is marked with a barcode -hence the reason no other pod will work! This item is just the sealable aluminum foil top that lets you cover over up a refilled Nespresso pod. So, you must hold onto used pods in order to use this option. TBH, this was something I didnt realize when ordering..!!After cleaning, rinsing and drying your used pods 100%- you refill with the coffee of choice. **OK, this is where the foil lids come in! Carefully place the sealable purchased lid atop of pod.. BE SURE NOT TO OBSCURE THE BAR CODE FOUND ON SIDE..!! Foil is a tad bigger in diameter then pod cup itself- so it gives a bit of forgiveness when putting it on! DONT BE INTIMIDATED- I actually found prepping a handful at one time helps to find a rhythm and make things less of hassle vs. filling x1 every morning!! Coffee grounds stay fresh inside the sealed pod. Once shut these will store in whatever method you usually use- box, basket, display rack etc. all with the same fit.. the cute outer prints are a fun aesthetic! But, these designs are actually a way to differentiate between what you chose to fill the pod with. For example if using cappuccino = sunburst, decaf = stripes, etc. you have total of 4 designs.Hack: setting a roll of T.P. tipped tube side up- is a solid way to balance pod while adhering the new lid.. I know, sounds crazy but it steadies it for you!! See photo to show what I mean-Sorry so long winded- wanted to help others avoid any confusion. A great option for variety while  saving both money and planet!

5.0,"""Come back to me.""","I'm not sure how old I was the first time I watched our beat-up VHS copy of Somewhere in Time; it had to be several years after my first visit to Mackinac Island at age four. Over the years, I've come to greatly appreciate the nuances (and standalone merits) of this most gentle and unique love story.The charming time-travel love story Somewhere in Time is based on Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return. The book is a deeply rewarding journey that reaches nuances and depths not present in the screen version, and is worth reading to compare. In the screen adaptation Somewhere in Time, Matheson also served as the screenwriter, lending the movie an unerring fidelity to the original work.Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve in his first role after [[ASIN:B000059Z8J Superman - The Movie]]) is a modern-day playwright in Chicago. As the film opens at a cast party for his latest work, an elderly woman walks up to him, instantly hushing the celebratory atmosphere, and deposits an engraved pocket watch in his hand, muttering, ""come back to me."" Richard brushes this off as the ravings of a senile woman until later, when a photograph shatters his indifference. Later, Richard seeks a weekend escape at Mackinac Island, Michigan after hitting the wall on his new work.Once checked into the Grand Hotel (one of the world's largest vintage summer resorts, with the world's longest covered patio facing Lake Michigan), he is haunted by the sensual photograph of a beautiful woman in the Grand Hotel's Hall of History, and races to dig up any and all information on the luminous beauty (leading to some fabulous shots of recognizable structures on Mackinac Island). Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) was a promising young stage actress managed by the dour, possessive W.F. Robinson (Christopher Plummer). Richard toys with the idea of self-hypnosis to travel back to 1912 in order to meet Elise when she was performing at the Grand Hotel, and after several attempts, he succeeds (or is it only the product of a desperate and haunted imagination?), and begins a slow wooing of Elise. Humorous ""fish out of water"" mishaps plague modern-day Richard, including wearing an antique suit that was already an antique by 1912, and the dangers of shaving with a straight razor.The phrase ""love at first sight"" doesn't quite capture the haunting sense of deja vu when Richard first speaks to Elise on the shore of Lake Michigan. A stricken Elise simply asks, ""Is it you?"" and Richard answers yes. It's as though the two have known each other for decades, or at least sensed the other's presence (the mechanics of said time travel, including the ""pocket watch loophole,"" are shaky at best). Their courtship is nearly thwarted by the machinations of the insanely jealous Robinson, who views Elise as his protegee (and property).The bittersweet romance comes to a tragic end, much in the same vein as [[ASIN:B000083C6R The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]] (which is a very similar ghost love story set in coastal England, but minus the time travel), but ultimately has a fulfilling ending.The cinematography of the 1912 portion is appropriately dreamy, with soft light permeating outdoor shots. The film's soundtrack by John Barry is quite possibly the most romantic I've ever heard, centered around a Rachmaninoff variation on a theme by Paganini. [[ASIN:B00000AFYL Somewhere In Time (1998 Re-recording)]] was quite literally the soundtrack of my youth; we would play it on trips to Northern Michigan, and on Mackinac Island in particular. Even if you never see the movie, it's worth purchasing the rerecorded Somewhere In Time soundtrack.Reeve, Seymour, and Plummer all put in heartfelt performances, and the true star of the show is Mackinac Island and the Grand Hotel in particular. Although long valued as a Midwest summer resort, Mackinac Island became an international tourist destination with the cult status of Somewhere in Time.The 20th-anniversary DVD features a one-hour documentary on the making of Somewhere in Time, with new interviews by the late Christopher Reeve (after being paralyzed from the neck down after a horseback accident in 1995), Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer, and other actors and crewmembers including director Jeannot Szwarc. Also included are cast and crew bios, production stills and notes, an audio commentary by Szwarc (I haven't listened to it yet, so I can't comment), a still photo gallery, the original theatrical trailer, and a segment on INSITE, the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts. All in all, the bonus features lend new depth for diehard fans of the movie, but will probably not interest casual fans.",2008-03-14 02:07:13.000,2.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,negative,0.6284469962120056,0.8191569447517395,['time'],5.0

1.0,A great career while it lasted,"Finally settled in last night to watch this movie. Let me start by saying that I love a good mystery and that I usually enjoy these kind of movies. Not much more can I say that hasn't been said before. First, the acting was absolutely awful. The movie is so scripted, it's almost as if the actors are reading their lines. The roles and characters are more than predictable (i.e. you have all token nationalities in the 'bad guy' gang, so they are equal opportunity offenders). I found most of the action in the fight scenes to be totally absurd. I could no more see Kim B. slinging a tire iron at someone (and getting it lodged in the victim's nostrils) then my mother doing it. It was almost comical. The underlying piece of Kim's marriage to an abusive man, was also ridiculously scripted and acted (damn, if any housewife kept a house as dirty and junk filled as she did, who wouldn't be yelling at her from time to time?). Anyway, just reliving this movie to write this review is painful. The movie was like a bad Saturday Night Live/MadTV skit.

4.0,Not Very Historically Accurate,"I am committing a sin here by reviewing a version that I haven't seen, but I wanted to make a comment or two about the movie itself for the one or two people who might never have seen it.  It's hard to find fault with this movie; it's wonderful family entertainment and the music is unforgettable.  That's part of the problem; the music has been played so much that you might be sick and tired of the songs.  The one I never tire of is ""Climb Every Mountain"".  The biggest problem with the movie is that it isn't very accurate.  We all know that Hollywood takes liberties with the truth, sometimes to make a movie more interesting than what the truth might be.  What I don't understand is why they do it when the truth itself is probably just as interesting or even more interesting.  A couple of notable examples; the names of all the children were changed in the movie.  Why not keep the original names?  Secondly, contrary to the movie where the father was so opposed to his children singing in public, he actually encouraged it because they needed to sing to help support the family that had gotten into dire financial circumstances.  The movie makes it seem like they were wealthy all the way through until leaving Austria.  It seems to me that the TRUE story would have been more interesting than this highly fictionalized account.  I hope they remake this one day with a little more attention to facts.  And following up with how they succeeded in America and what they did would be a wonderful sequel.  This movie has been shown so many times on television and I have seen so often that I am sick of it.  My wife loves the movie and can watch it anytime.  It is on at least once a year, so why buy a copy?  It's a movie that won't go away any time soon.  A classic love story based on true events.  Just be warned that it takes a lot of liberties with the facts.  I am surprised that the real Maria Von Trapp gave this movie such a favorable nod.

Max has lived with his grim grandparents since the time that his father murdered his mother, and leads a painful existence at school. He rarely emerges from his basement room, terrified that he's too stupid and huge, and most importantly, that he takes after his homicidal father.When Kevin moves next door, Max only wants to be invisible and is humiliated when Kevin becomes his reading tutor. But the unexpected happens: Kevin introduces Max to the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and Max begins to harness the power of imagination. The two work out an arrangement where Max serves as Kevin's legs, and Kevin as Max's brain. The two are involved in several hair-raising adventures and flights of fancy until an unexpectedly violent event that changes both their lives. The screenplay stays fairly close to the original novel, which is a huge plus.The Mighty is a prime example of an all-star cast used to full advantage. Kieran Culkin, even though able-bodied, does an admirable job as brainiac Kevin without becoming a caricature of his disability.

It's just a string of hate-filled violence with no real sense of direction or resolution. Compare it to the Bourne movies where you feel a real tie to Bourne and his survival instinct and goal of finding himself and regaining his identity and freedom. Here, a man takes some revenge on a lot of people, and though he's really good at it, the motive just doesn't catch the attention. Even Taken, which was also pretty violent, does a better job with the emotional tie-in than this movie.I would say don't bother. Who wants to watch mindless violence?

5.0,This film is an absolute charmer!,"Hayao Miyazaki's ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is based on a series of children's stories by Eiko Kadono. Kiki is a thirteen-year-old witch, and must go out into the world to begin her training. Her mother is also a witch, a vanishing breed. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) and her black cat Jiji (voiced by Phil Hartman) set out to find a town to call their very own. After a disheartening evening of meeting up with a snooty witch-in-training and getting caught flying in a thunderstorm, the pair wakes up to a sunny day and new adventures.Kiki finds herself in Koriko, a beautiful seaside city modeled after Europe's genteel capitals, and in the capable, grateful hands of Osono, a pregnant baker. Her new talent seems to be delivering items on her broomstick, and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is born. Kiki and Jiji take up lodgings at the bakery and soon are delivering every sort of item imaginable, from fish pies to stuffed cats to heavy boxes, and naturally, get into scrapes along the way. Young Jeff is fascinated by Kiki and her ability to fly (he is in a young pilots' club), and the two begin a bashful courtship of sorts. But one day, Kiki finds that her magical powers are fading--she can no longer fly or talk to Jiji....Many of Miyazaki's films feature strong female heroines, and Kiki is no exception. From Kiki's mother mixing potions, to Osono's successful bakery, to Ursula's career as a female artist and Kiki's own quest for independence, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" promotes a message of ""girl power"" and believing in oneself that makes it a good role model for young girls. Part of Kiki's charm is her awkwardness at becoming a teenager, and her magical troubles stem from self-doubt that, when corrected, finds her in flying form once again.Beautiful artwork, an old world musical score full of Parisian accordion and European charm, and a timeless story are enhanced by Disney's choice of A-list actors for the English dub (Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman, Janeane Garofalo). DVD comes in English, Spanish, and the original Japanese dub (with two choices of subtitles: the literal translation and the captions used in the English version), along with several extras (original Japanese trailers, ""Behind the Microphone"" with John Lasseter).",2006-03-02 20:58:48.000,4.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.9901810884475708,0.730316698551178,['watch'],5.0

The DVD does have a making-of featurette and a few deleted scenes, one of which should have been left in the film (Armande's letter to Vianne) as it clarified and added a great deal of meaning.

5.0,Another hilarious sendup from the pleasantly warped Paul Gross,"Mention Paul Gross to an American, and the image that most people come up with is the uberpolite, by-the-book Mountie Benton Fraser from the Canadian series ""[[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]]"". Paul's dark, quirky humor still managed to surface through Frasier's naive act, particularly in the final seasons of the show. Now ask a Canadian; no doubt some will bring up [[ASIN:B00092ZSYM H2O]], a Canadian political thriller in which Gross plays the prime minister. Odds are, another Canadian will bring up [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]], Paul's directorial debut and attempt at a quintessential (if not the only) Canadian curling comedy. Next, ask a loyal Stratford theatre buff about Paul; no doubt that you'll hear of his brilliant performances as Hamlet in 2000. Paul is also a vocal advocate of the arts within Canada and an accomplished musician.Paul's many talents truly come together on Slings and Arrows, a sendup of the internationally-known Stratford Shakespeare Festival. For those not in the know, Stratford, Ontario (named after Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-Upon-Avon) hosts a lavish Shakespearian theater festival that runs for seven months a year, featuring some of the brightest stars of stage and screen.Slings and Arrows is titled after Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1) and is set in fictional New Burbage, a small, rural town that briefly flowers during tourist season. The New Burbage theater company is worn and uninspired, anchored by diva Ellen Fanshaw (played by Paul Gross's wife, Martha Burns). The artistic director Oliver Wells (Steven Ouimette) is a washed-up thespian and alcoholic who views the theater as a cash cow, nothing more. Across town, Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross) is struggling to save a small theater (Theatre Sans Argent, or ""Theater Without Money"") from eviction. Tennant suffered a mental breakdown seven years ago during one of Wells' productions of Hamlet, and it ended his career in the theater. On the opening night of A Midsummer Night's Dream, a very drunk Oliver calls Geoffrey from a payphone, passes out in the street, and is run over by a truck. His ghost haunts Geoffrey, who has become the interim artistic director of the festival.Which is all...very Shakespearian in nature. The show is rich with irony, and I found myself frequently laughing at unexpected flashes of brilliance. Add to the mix the quirky cast of actors, backstage antics, and theater in-jokes, and you have an effervescent satire of theater and the state of the arts in Canada.There are subplots involving American corporate sponsors, pot, budding love interests, and old rivalries. The dialogue is witty, the editing airtight, and the rousing opening and closing singalongs (""Cheer Up, Hamlet!"" and ""Call the Understudy"") make this a blast. Add to the fact that many members of the cast and crew are theater vets (Burns, Gross, Ouimette, Susan Coyne, and William Hutt all performed at Stratford) and Canadian screen stars (Don McKellar, Sarah Polley, Rachael McAdams).Though the show is beloved by many who work in the theater, non-thespians will find Slings and Arrows equally engrossing. My ""theater"" background consists of working backstage on one or two high school plays and a visit to Stratford in 2002, and I absolutely loved Slings and Arrows for its blend of comedy, outstanding performances, razor-sharp dialogue, and glimpse at the backstage craziness and camaraderie. Extras include a trailer that's best left until after you've watched the first season, outtakes, production notes, cast filmographies, a list of the series' credits, and lyrics to ""Cheer Up Hamlet"" and ""Call the Understudy.""",2007-09-20 18:50:43.000,18.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.9288849830627441,0.9087573289871216,[],4.0

5.0,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" a harrowing tale of loss and courage","Phillip Noyce's ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is based on the true story of Daisy, Molly and Gracie, three half-caste children in Western Australia in 1931. The Australian government continued enforcing until 1970 a law that allowed mixed race children to be removed forcibly from their parents and sent to boarding schools to ""educate"" them for a white world. The girls were trained to be servants and domestics. The whole system was similar to the Indian schools in the United States, where First Nations children were sent to be raised as pious, productive, educated young adults, but the system there too frequently failed. The plan was that the half-caste girls would marry whites or other half-castes and have the Aboriginal ""bred out of them,"" as policy director A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) explains to a local ladies' society.Daisy, Molly and Gracie are sent to the Moore River Native Settlement in Perth, over 2000 kilometres from their home in Jigalong Station. They do not last more than a few days before Molly, the ringleader, plans their escape through brush and desert, finding her way home by following the rabbit-proof fence, the longest in the world, that divides pasture from rabbit-infested bush. Neville and his men, including a skilled Aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (film veteran David Gulpilil) search for weeks in pursuit of the girls, and one is eventually recaptured in a harrowing scene, only steps from safety with the other girls.There is very little in the way of dialogue, and although Noyce's child actors are all unskilled, there are remarkable performances and true moments of fear, desperation, and grief shine through. The girls' mother and grandmother are particularly effective at conveying the mind-shattering grief they must live with knowing that they may never see their girls again. In one touching scene, at separate points on the fence, thousands of kilometres apart, both the mother and the girls tightly grip the fence, lightly shaking it, as if they could feel the resulting vibrations and sense the others' presence there.The cinematography shows off the dry palette of the desert, the spectacular desert sunsets, the shimmering wave of heat that covers the landscape. This film reminded me in some ways of the 1971 Australian film ""Walkabout,"" which starred Gulpilil as an Aboriginal teenager, and follows two white children that are stranded in the outback with only Gulpilil as a guide. The ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" score by Peter Gabriel is low-key and appropriately tension-filled, meditative and mysterious at key moments, with wisps of Aboriginal chant and song woven into a lush synth background, and reminded me of the excellent soundtrack to Australian sci-fi series ""Ocean Girl"" by Garry McDonald and Laurie Stone. The narration at the beginning and end of the movie was the most powerful for me: the real-life Molly and Daisy, now old women in bright clothes that are startlingly out of place against the backdrop of the outback they slowly walk through, tell how the story ended. And that was the saddest truth of all.The included documentary ""Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" shows Noyce flying to remote outback communities looking for Aboriginal child actors, auditioning thousands of hopefuls before settling on the final three, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan, as well as the emotional journey for the temperamental star and the harrowing experience of filming the girls' abduction at the hands of a white officer. Pretty much the whole cast and crew was in tears and shaken afterwards, forced to relive the crucial moment that defined the ""Stolen Generations:"" the theft from their mothers' arms, some never to be seen or heard from again.An excellent film that treats a little-known subject outside of Australia (and fairly unspoken within), with the fresh-faced innocence of children who beat the odds and found their way home across 2000 km of largely uninhabited, hostile terrain to the waiting arms of their family.",2003-05-17 12:17:54.000,13.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.6687276363372803,0.5503420829772949,"['und', 'enjoyed']",5.0

The discerning of today and future generations may look upon some aspects of today's science (e.g. evolution and cosmology) and find that it is seeded with deception and fraught with inaccuracies that are taught in schools and ingrained in children at an early age, and conclude that it too was a deliberate ""manufacturing of belief.""It is true that many organizations, institutions, and states have commandeered religions for their own social and political purposes.  But that doesn't mean the religion itself should be repudiated as a consequence.  And this is where the documentary makes an illogical leap - that religion should be rejected entirely because of the unethical psychological methods employed by the leadership of certain churches to mesmerize and brainwash its members into faith.But the individual may find merit in particular religion(s) after eliminating the structure, the ritual, the congregation, and the leaders, and instead consult directly the holy scriptures upon which major religions are based: (e.g. The Torah, The Bible Old Testament OR New Testament, The Qur'an, etc.).  Read them yourself.  You may find unexpected meaning, significance, and familiarity with what is contained therein which resonates with your own personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs.

3.0,"A rather charming tale of conspiracies, birds, love and food","""Rare Birds"" chronicles the life of Dave (William Hurt), chef of ""The Auk"" in a small coastal town in Newfoundland. Business is sagging, and Dave is preparing to sell the restaurant when wacky Fonce (Newfoundlander Andy Jones in a brilliant turn as always) cooks up a scheme involving the sighting of a rare bird (in reality, an extinct duck) to bring flocks of birdwatchers to the area and boost business. The plan works, but the two get more than they bargain for: there are numerous other subplots, some unnecessary, such as the cocaine stash, a love affair between Dave and Alice, Fonce's bookish sister-in-law, the RCMP Bulgarian light conspiracy, and the Winnebegos.Molly Parker's Alice was a delight, as was Andy Jones' neurotic Fonce. I thought that the entire cocaine subplot was unnecessary. The bathroom humour seemed too base as well, although limited to one (thankfully) brief scene. Although Ebert regards ""Rare Birds"" as more of a wacky Newfoundland character study than ""The Shipping News,"" I disagree. I found that ""The Shipping News"" had a much more engaging plot and much more involved characters. The pacing of ""Rare Birds"" is sometimes slow and awkward, and I didn't really relate to Hurt's character, which made it much harder to enjoy the film as a whole.The DVD offers very little in the way of special features, mainly a few computer-generated sets from production designs, a trailer (which shows what the film *could * have been if it had lost the excess baggage) and a commentary by director Sturla Gunnarsson.

4.0,"Believe in yourself, not your appearance","Penelope is a modern-day fairytale involving a family curse: as revenge for an unjust death, a witch curses the Wilherns so that their first daughter will be born with the face of a pig. For several generations, only males are born, but when Penelope (Christina Ricci) comes along, the curse is fulfilled, and she's born with a pig's snout. Her parents (Catherine O'Hara from Beetlejuice and and Richard E. Grant channeling Christopher Walken) keep her locked away after faking her death so that the paparazzi will steer clear.Now in her mid-twenties, the sheltered Penelope has several talents, including botany, chess, and music (and Penelope's vintage glam costumes are to die for). She's a voracious reader as well, with a library full of rare, valuable first editions. Every week, her overbearing mother makes her meet several potential suitors (bluebloods) in an attempt to break the curse: in order for that to happen, Penelope must be loved by ""one of her own kind."" Most jump out the second-story window in horror when they see Penelope face-to-face, describing her as a gruesome monster (in all fairness, the pig makeup is underwhelming; I saw her face and went, ""that's it?!?""). The butler's job is to catch the escaping suitors to prevent them from blabbing to the press, but one particularly loathsome character, Edward Vanderman the Third (Simon Woods), escapes and sensationalizes Penelope into a drooling, savage monster with razor-sharp fangs; the story is printed on the front page of local newspapers, complete with caricature straight out of the Exorcist.At the same time, down-and-out gambler Max (James McAvoy, [[ASIN:B00005JNV9 Rory O'Shea Was Here]], [[ASIN:B000ZIZ0RA Becoming Jane]] and [[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)]]) accepts $5,000 for secretly snapping photos of Penelope, and pretends to be genuinely interested in her brains, not her looks. Predictably, the two feel a genuine attraction before long, but Max's secret as a spy is discovered, and he's banished from the house. The rest of the film focuses on Penelope's escape and quest for independence.Quirky, with loveable characters and some not-so-loveable ones rounding out the cast, Penelope feels like a lost Tim Burton film; the zany dialogue reminded me of Beetlejuice at points, as did the dark, twisted visuals. The message of ""love who you are, not what you look like"" is beat over your head about a million times, and Catherine O'Hara as the stage mom is particularly loathsome as she obsesses over plastic surgery for Penelope and other ways to make her daughter ""normal."" But I found Penelope to be an engaging fairytale, if a little long, in large part due to the sparkling performances of Ricci and McAvoy.On a final note, it appears that Penelope has been edited from the theatrical version, with several scenes shortened and some swearing removed. Also, according to posters at IMDB, the music has also been redone. This is a shame, and in large part it's due to some confused marketing; although this would appear to be a children's fairy tale, it's largely adult (Penelope becomes drunk, steals her mother's credit card, etc., there's a blatant sexual reference from Reese Witherspoon's character), and should never have been marketed primarily as addressed towards children. Hopefully, the original theatrical version will be released at some point. Extras include an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Twilight (a new scene, some behind-the-scenes footage, and brief interviews with director Catherine Hardwicke, author Stephenie Meyer, and several of the stars).",2008-08-01 22:52:42.000,4.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,negative,0.46569743752479553,0.8335990309715271,['accurate'],3.0
4.0,Interesting Portrait of Howard Hughes,"This portrait of Hughes shows him both as a forward looking genius who took tremendous chances that ended in great success and as a reclusive eccentric with mental problems.  Is it accurate?  I don't know.  I have two problems with this movie.  First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio was not convincing as Howard Hughes.  He tried very hard, but it just doesn't quite succeed.  I think he is still too young and inexperienced to really pull it off.  It's not a terrible job of acting, but nothing spectacular either.  Perhaps a very difficult role to do.  The second problem was the ending.  The movie just stopped without any real conclusion.  I guess after almost 3 hours, they had to end it at some point.  I was disappointed that they didn't follow the story on a little further and make it more of a full biography.  It would have been too long then, but some scenes could have been cut and the movie could have completed Hughes life within 3 hours.  If nothing else, the movie inspired me to want to read more about Hughes and find out how many liberties they took in the film.  Did Hughes really drink only milk from a sealed bottle?  Was he a cleanliness freak?  Did his mental illness cause him to repeat something over and over again?  How much that went on between TWA and Pan Am in the movie actually occurred?  Was Hughes a big ladies man and did he and Kate Hepburn have a relationship for quite some time, as the movies suggests?  The movie held my interest from start to finish, so for that I give it 4 stars.  Is it really a 4-star movie?  Perhaps not, but it was very entertaining and that's what movies are supposed to do--entertain you.  Hughes was such an interesting man, a true documentary biography might have been actually more far more enjoyable than this fictionalized account.",2007-08-24 22:00:06.000,1.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.4463994801044464,0.8962253928184509,"['foul', 'offended', 'part']",5.0

Amazingly both in this movie and in real life, just a little kindness often goes a long way to change hardened hearts and sad, lonely people.  The movie works because it truly demonstrates that there is still a lot of hope, even for those who seem to lost all hope.  Superb casting, especially Stephen Baldwin.

4.0,Fans of Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Somewhere in Time will adore Portrait of Jennie,"Jennifer Jones ([[ASIN:B00008LDO7 The Song of Bernadette]]) and Joseph Cotten star in Portrait of Jennie, a 1948 film that revolved around a painter's obsession with a beautiful, mysterious girl who seems to live more in the past than the present. Eben Adams (Cotten) is a washed-up painter on hard times and lacks inspiration until he meets Jennie (Jones) in a New York park. Jennie has an unusual way of speaking about past events as though they are current (referring to Germany's kaiser, and to theaters that had been demolished). Her fresh-faced beauty appeals to Adams, and Jennie makes the wish that he wait for her to grow up so that they can be together.Jennie's sporadic appearances allow time for Eben to work on other commissions, and to research Jennie more carefully by interviewing people who had worked with her parents (famous high-wire circus performers). Inevitably, dark truths are uncovered that disturb Eben's ""painting-perfect"" romance with the soft-spoken, beautiful Jennie. His portrait of her is a testament to his love and brings him artistic fame. Eben is also introduced to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore), a headstrong old maid who deals in paintings and who wants to see Eben produce something more spiritual. Other notable names include Lillian Gish as Mother Mary of Mercy, Cecil Kellaway as Matthews, and a young Nancy Davis Reagan in the art gallery.Joseph Cotten is an engaging narrator, and his growing dependence on Jennie and his depression over Jennie's long absences is utterly believable (if a bit melodramatic). Jennifer Jones has more to work with here than in her first Oscar-winning role as Bernadette, although seeing a well-proportioned twentysomething trying to portray prepubescent innocence was a little bit creepy (see: Judy Garland in [[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]). Her character ages rapidly both physically and psychologically, so Jones was able to display a range of emotions, from a childhood crush to deeper musings on the nature of love and faith. Some of the secondary characters suffer from disappearing Irish accents; others shamelessly (sometimes woodenly) overact.The film follows several conventions of its time, and appears dated. The ""special effects"" are pretty standard; several scale models are used and a green tint is used for the final scenes. There are some beautifully dreamy shots of New York City, and the fabulous effect of having shots appear as though they were painted on canvas. The DVD transfer features some artifacts and print flaws. There are no extras to speak of. However, fans of time-travel romances [[ASIN:B000083C6R The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]and [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]] will enjoy Portrait of Jennie, although the strongest film of this genre is undoubtedly The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.

4.0,A romantic world of candlelight and poetry,"This was one of the first ""grownup"" TV shows I remember taking an interest in back when it came out (I was seven). At the time, I was entranced by the visuals, but the more adult elements (romance, intimacy, and urban problems of poverty and discrimination) were lost on me. However, as soon as I heard that Beauty and the Beast had been released to DVD, I rushed out to buy a copy, and the stories and lush visuals don't disappoint.In the TV series, the role of Beauty is Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton), a corporate lawyer who is nearly killed in a case of mistaken identity. Brutally beaten and disfigured in a razor attack, she is discovered by the reclusive Vincent (Ron Perlman), part man, part beast who lives in the tunnels below New York City. Vincent and his adopted father (Roy Dotrice) nurse Catherine back to health. Once she returns to the World Above, as Vincent calls it, she is a changed woman and decides to work for the District Attorney's Office in order to help other survivors of violent crimes.  Catherine and Vincent share a strong platonic bond, and although there is definite romantic chemistry between them, they are unable to act on it. Vincent reads Catherine wonderfully romantic, evocative classic love poems; these are also available on the [[ASIN:B000BLI3BG Beauty & the Beast]] CD.First and foremost, the show is carried by Ron Perlman, who makes the lion/man Vincent a deeply sensitive, poetic, and yes, romantic figure aware of his limitations in Catherine's world. Linda Hamilton as Catherine Chandler is beautiful both inside and out;  deeply concerned for the welfare of others, she has chosen her job from altruism, not for money (her father is rich). Catherine becomes familiar with Vincent's world, where those who are different have found a safe haven under Vincent's wing, so to speak, including Mouse (David Greenlee) and Pascal (Armin Shimerman from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine).  Another notable name is Tony Jay as Paracelcus, a villain who threatens Vincent's world below.The 22 first-season episodes range from mediocre (""Masques,"" with some of the worst Irish accents heard on screen), to captivating (""Fever,"" ""An Impossible Silence,"" ""Nor Iron Bars a Cage""). Given, the show's '80s values (especially production values) do date it quite a bit, but the interplay between characters (and the romantic tension between Catherine and her boss Joe) and Vincent's lush, mysterious world of damp tunnels tempered by candlelight carry the viewer's interest.The film's transfer is grainy and blurry, with scratches particularly noticeable on the pilot. The overall video transfer is inconsistent, and that's a shame. Audio quality is decent. The lack of extras is deplorable, particularly given the show's fierce cult following. The packaging is both space-saving and well thought out, although it's hard to read the synopses when the discs are on top of them. Overall, fans of the series will want to snap this up. If you're looking to collect all three seasons, it might be better to hold out for the complete series set [[ASIN:B001AZIRZO Beauty and the Beast: The Complete Series]], which promises new extras.",2008-06-21 12:56:47.000,1.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.8677995800971985,0.6075334548950195,[],5.0

5.0,Haunting true-life drama of abandonment and the resilience of children,"""Dare mo shiranai"" (Nobody Knows) by Kore-eda Hirokazu is all the more poignant for being based on a real-life scandal in Japan. In 1988, four children were found abandoned by their mother, living for six months in a squalid Tokyo apartment with no running water, electricity, or food, where one of the children, weakened by malnutrition, was accidentally killed.As the film begins, the family is moving into yet another apartment; they are continuously evicted for having too many children. The two youngest children arrive smuggled in suitcases, already a sign of the startling neglect to come, as the mother portrays this as a game. The hot, tired children unfold from their suitcase prisons as the mother laughs, claps her hands and tells them ""Good job!"" in her Minnie Mouse voice. The children's flighty mother is barely more than a child herself, unable to cope with real life and care for her large brood (each child has a different father).It is never explicitly stated what her job is, but she frequently leaves the children for long stretches of time, expecting eldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) to care for ten-year-old Kyoko, seven-year-old Shigeru, and five-year-old Yuki. The children are like children everywhere: they long to play outside, be rambunctious, play in the park, be free to dream. Instead, they are virtual prisoners, unable to leave the apartment lest they be caught. Even the small balcony is off limits. Akira does all of the outside shopping, bill paying, and cooking. None of the children go to school. ""Why do you want to go to school?"" their mother asks. ""Famous people don't go to school."" Like who? Akira demands. His mother can't come up with a suitable answer.The inevitable happens: their mother is infatuated with the latest boyfriend, and skips town for good. Akira holds off telling the other children for as long as possible; after all, their mother is frequently gone for months at a time. He is forced to spend down, but it isn't enough. The utilities are eventually cut off, and the apartment descends into a pit of hell, with garbage covering everything. The children must use the bathroom in the park and wash their clothes in a fountain, and survive off of leftover sushi handouts. Akira falls in with a group of thug-like high schoolers who use him, taunt him, and try to get him to shoplift, and the youngest children suffer the most. Somber Kyoko taps out melodies on her toy piano, Shigeru breaks the rules by running wild outside, and Yuki colors and draws pictures that cover every inch of the apartment. Their situation becomes more and more dire; even though the landlord's wife has seen the state of the apartment, no social services are called in. The children are left to fester as their clothes unravel and they slowly succumb to malnutrition. An accident occurs, prompted out of boredom, that changes their close-knit lives. The ending is sparse, haunting, and we are not told what becomes of the children, or if their mother was ever found.The child actors were essentially filmed living in the apartment throughout an entire year of filming, so in some ways, ""Nobody Knows"" plays out like a documentary. The scene where they play in the park for the first time was really their first time leaving the apartment in months. It is heartwrenching to watch them spying on ""normal"" children down below, children who take school for granted, are allowed to ride bikes and play in the park. There is no creative outlet, no exercise, no nourishing food, and yet, although weakened, their spirits still demonstrate the resilience of childhood. Kore-eda's haunting portrait of solitude and survival at its darkest is difficult to watch, but worth the journey.",2005-12-08 12:47:00.000,6.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.7272340655326843,0.9792008399963379,[],5.0

5.0,A magical family film that brings Ireland home....,"""Into the West"" is an underrated jewel of Irish filmmaking that follows a rather unconventional storyline: a down-and-out father, Papa Reilly, (Gabriel Byrne), leads a miserable existence in a Dublin slum along with his two young sons.  The poverty and bleakness is overwhelming and not what one would expect from a Disney film (which it is).  Starving children sing on streetcorners for money, fathers drink away the welfare money, and education and sanitary conditions seem alien. This is not the Ireland of ""The Quiet Man"" or even ""The Secret of Roan Inish.""Papa Reilly is a traveller, or gypsy, although he has forsaken the old ways after his wife's death. His father-in-law tries to convince him in vain to return to the roads, but Reilly stands firm, insolently refusing all help. His two sons Tito and Ossie fall in love with a mysterious white horse that has followed their grandfather's caravan, and the two claim Tir na Nog as their own (but the horse had claimed them first). The lines between fantasy and reality are blurred, and this is not just a children's film, nor is it solely for an older audience. It is hybrid of mythology and magic much like ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" another Irish fairytale of a film that also dealt with magical animals (in that case seals).The rest of the movie requires suspension of disbelief, including several improbable chase scenes, but the heartwarming stories of the two boys coming to terms with their past (their mother's death, their father's alcoholism) and forging stronger bonds of brotherhood, and the grieving father and widower coming to terms with his loss and resolving to start a new life with his sons as the king of the travellers once more, truly make this a touching and unforgettable film.The scenery is beautiful, from the bleak, grey Dublin slums to the gently sloping western mountains, spectacular craggy cliffs and crashing seaspray. The soundtrack is a blend of Irish music old and new, with contributions from Black 47, the Rankin Family and Clannad. Patrick Doyle (""Shipwrecked"") composed the score, which uses Irish instruments and haunting Irish Gaelic vocals to build atmosphere.There are several tense moments during action sequences which may prove frightening to younger children, but nothing overly objectionable in ""Into The West."" Younger children may find it a bit slow and hard to follow, but patience is truly a virtue in the case of this magical film.",2002-07-07 00:39:44.000,99.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.9838048815727234,0.5816421508789062,"['Action', 'thriller']",5.0

4.0,Another fine example of Canadian humor...that you'll never see in the US,"I first read about Bon Cop, Bad Cop while riding the train to Montreal. There was a bilingual featurette on the film in VIA Rail's magazine, and I was instantly intrigued. I'd seen Colm Feore at Stratford four years ago, and I was familiar with Patrick Huard from the [[ASIN:B0006HM1TA Les Boys 1, 2 and 3 (Box Set)]] hockey film franchise. I studied at Laval University in Quebec City for two months, and specialized in Quebec Studies (history, literature, and cinema) as an undergraduate, so I was intrigued to see how the film would balance both the bilingual and bicultural aspects of living in Canada. The issue of Quebec is a contentious one for a number of political, social, and cultural reasons. Bon Cop, Bad Cop attempts to use humor in an attempt to defuse volatile issues between the Two Solitudes (English- and French-speaking Canada).A series of brutal murders in the Canadian hockey community pairs together two very different cops: Torontonian Martin Ward, (Colm Feore) a by-the-book, prim-and-proper intellectual, and rough-and-tumble David Bouchard, a shoot first, ask later detective from Montreal. Naturally, the two despise each other at first sight, and the rapid-fire bilingual one-liners between Martin and David are fast and furious from the get-go. Some critics panned the film for a seemingly forced, unnatural balance of bilingual script, but as someone who's trilingual, I frequently switch languages when speaking to other bilingual friends; nothing unnatural there.Much of the comedic humor comes from the culture clash between Martin and David, Ontario and Quebec; there are numerous in-jokes regarding Canadian law, stereotypes of Quebeckers (diehard smokers, dangerous drivers, womanizers) and Torontonians (cold, boring, workaholics) and nods to popular Canadian culture (Rick Mercer of [[ASIN:B000W00XXW This Hour Has 22 Minutes-Season 1]] does a great Don Cherry impression, Uniprix commercial spoof, cameo by Nanette Workman). There are some hilarious scenes involving tortured translation between the Quebec police chief and his Ontarian counterpart as the two (fully bilingual) detectives watch in disbelief. The secondary characters really shine, from a speed-talking coroner (Quebecois comedian Louis-José Houde) to Martin's glamorous, hip sister who's hot for David, as does the bilingual script. The special effects are very well done considering that the film had an $8 million budget.In the vein of earlier Canadian comedies like [[ASIN:B00006FDCT Strange Brew]] and [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]] (a curling ""comedy"" from Paul Gross aka Constable Benton Frasier of [[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]]), Bon Cop, Bad Cop is a sendup of that great Canadian pastime, hockey. Of course, beer, curling, beavers, and the fleur de lis make prerequisite appearances, as does marijuana (there is a priceless scene involving a self-destructing marijuana greenhouse that brought to mind the British comedy [[ASIN:B00003CXMY Saving Grace]]). Romantic interest? Check. (You'll never think of ""Vive le Quebec libre!"" quite the same way again...) Action? Car chases? Explosions? Check. The weakest part of the film is the villain, who is never really developed; we never know, or care, why he turned psychotic. There is also a gratuitous amount of violence and swearing (nearly all in French) that seemed over-the-top, but it's obvious from the start that this is a film that has no intentions of taking itself seriously.Looking at these elements separately, Bon Cop, Bad Cop would appear to be another shallow attempt at creating a uniquely ""Canadian"" comedy. But there is an unexpected depth and tenderness in the character development between Martin, David and their respective families (both men are divorced single parents), and the bilingual dialogue really shines. Huard and Feore give standout performances, and I felt right at home in that strange limbo between Quebec and Ontario from my experiences in both English- and French-speaking Canada. This is a gem that deserves to be seen!",2008-05-18 16:26:28.000,23.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.7525960803031921,0.9675890207290649,[],5.0

5.0,"A good overview of Ireland's charms, from the Ring of Kerry to the Aran Islands.","Rick Steves, host of ""Europe Through The Back Door"" and creator of a European tour company of the same name, introduces viewers to the sights, sounds, and tastes of Ireland in this 2004 ""Best of Ireland"" collection taken from his TV show. The DVD is divided into several sections: Dublin, The Best of South Ireland: Glendalough, Waterford, Kinsale and More, The Best of West Ireland: Dingle, Galway and the Aran Islands, Belfast and the Best of Northern Ireland, and a bonus interview (approximate runtime 2 hours).Rick provides a whirlwind overview of the main sights, including Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and Guinness (Dublin), the Waterford factory, Rock of Cashel, the monastery at Glendalough, Powerscourt Gardens, Blarney Castle, Giants Causeway and Belfast. We hear from charming local guides talking about Irish customs, and see Rick and family chipping in with drying hay (Aran Islands), see peat stacked to dry, and how farmers create movable gates in stone walls. Rick talks to a guide at a 13th-century lighthouse (one of the oldest in Europe), listens in on native Irish Gaelic speakers chatting with each other, boards a replica of a famine ship complete with costumed actors, and drives across Ireland with his wife Anne and two children, Andy and Jackie, in tow (his son Andy is currently blogging his way across Europe on a backpacking trip). He serves as a very down-to-earth guide, and offers several off-the-beaten path dining and boarding suggestions. I am planning on taking Rick's ""Best of Ireland"" tour next year, and this was a great introduction to what awaits.Kudos for the beautiful cinematography (lots of aerial footage of the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry) and authentic Irish background music -- with one or two exceptions, there was none of the horrible canned pseudo-Irish synth music that graces so many travel DVDs. For more info, check out Rick's travel guide on Ireland (Rick Steves' Ireland 2006, ISBN: 1566917263), with plenty more unusual sights, sounds, and tastes that bring you the best of Ireland in a laid-back, local flavour.",2005-11-08 14:18:48.000,13.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.7411227822303772,0.5699023604393005,[],5.0
5.0,"An enduring tale of love, courage and trust","Don Bluth's &quot;The Secret Of NIMH,&quot; based upon the novel &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,&quot; was released in 1982 and was quickly forgotten at the box office in favour of Steven Spielberg's E.T. (which was released around the same time). I picked this up for less than ten dollars on DVD and I haven't stopped playing it since. It has been at least fifteen years since I had last seen it, and I enjoy it more than ever.Bluth and close to two dozen Disney animators defected from Disney's studios in favour of having a chance to express and explore their artistic visions and creativity. One of their first animated films was &quot;The Secret of NIMH.&quot; Other Bluth films include &quot;Anastasia,&quot; and &quot;An American Tail.&quot; But no other animated film captures the sense of magic and wonder like &quot;The Secret of NIMH.&quot;Mrs. Brisby, a recently widowed field mouse, tries desperately to protect her invalid son Timothy from Moving Day, when the farmer's plough will destroy their underground home. She is led to a colony of superintelligent rats, ex-subjects of laboratory experiments at the National Institute of Mental Health. They are led by wise old Nicodemus, a friend of Mrs. Brisby's late husband Jonathan, also an escaped lab mouse from NIMH.The somewhat dark tale does feature light-hearted comedic relief in the form of Jeremy, a trouble-prone young crow voiced by Dom Deluise. The story sticks fairly close to the book version, although several new elements are added and some side plots are cut due to time restraints. The artwork is breathtaking; vibrant backgrounds, clever special effects, the play of light and shadow. The characters are real and you quickly become attached to them. No one breaks into song every five minutes, although there is a very beautiful lullaby on the soundtrack that Mrs. Brisby sings to Timothy.To me, this film is deeper, darker, and more imaginative than anything that Disney has produced. There are no fancy CGI effects, only the skilful work of animators that love what they do. The film carries a message of courage, love, and trust without being preachy or simple. There are plenty of tense, dark scenes, some of which might upset smaller children. But &quot;Secret of NIMH&quot; is a beautiful, intelligent movie that is so much more than a cartoon or a children's fable.",2001-12-26 02:21:22.000,3.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.7434869408607483,0.8542234301567078,['Man'],5.0

2.0,Very Strange Story,"Tell me what you think of this plot:  A child comes back to life to confront the mother who cut her throat, only she is a grown woman, but still talks like a child.  Meanwhile this so-called ghost manages to seduce her mother's ""boyfriend"" who has come back after 18 years.  The ghost manages to get pregnant by him.  Then the ""ghost"", totally naked and pregnant is brought out on the front porch by her mother and disappears in a couple of minutes when a group of church ladies start chanting and singing spiritual songs from the road in front of the house.  Then the mother goes into depression for having lost the child that has come back to her and her other daughter goes to work for rich white folks to support herself and her mother.  That's Beloved in a nutshell.  And let's not forget another ghost that you don't see at all; just her poltergeist activity, except you do see that ghost in the flesh near the end of the movie (and in flashbacks to a prior time).  And people think this is a great movie?  It's a very strange movie and I couldn't tell what the message was supposed to be, if there even was one.  The one redeeming thing about the movie is the period costumes and scenery, which is very beautifully done.  It takes place in the 1800's and you certainly do feel that you have been taken back in time.",2008-10-05 04:27:14.000,2.0,False,Movies_and_TV,en,positive,0.6622396111488342,0.9814669489860535,"['story', 'pretty']",4.0
